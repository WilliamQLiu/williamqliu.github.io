title: Flu Aware, an Android App
---

# {{ page.title }}


## Summary

Back in 2011 I created an Android app (my first mobile app) for a programming competition hosted by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov). The goal was to raise awareness about the flu. My submission explains the flu, steps to fight the flu, streams the CDC's flu podcasts, finds a nearby flu vaccine clinic based on your location, and allows you to (un)subscribe to their text messages easily.

### Disclaimer

The Android app was created back in early 2011 (back when Android releases were by number).

## Install

It's available for free on the [Android Market here](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.wliu.cdcfluaware&amp;feature=search_result)

## Code

The code is freely available and can be downloaded at [Github here](https://github.com/WilliamQLiu/android-java-examples/tree/master/fluaware)
