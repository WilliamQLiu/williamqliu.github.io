##<a id="summary">Summary</a>

__Go__ is an open source programming language that focuses on __concurrency__ (i.e.  instead of sequentially/one after another).

###Why Go?

There's __sequential computing__, which runs one command first, then another as soon as the first is completed.  __Concurrent computing__ is different in that it has many computations executing during overlapping time periods.  

__Concurrent computing__ is commonly confused with __Parallel computing__, but it doesn't have to mean the same.  Parallel computing has the additional restriction that the computations are working towards a single goal so that it's also more efficient, whereas concurrent is mainly trying to tackle complexity by simplifying the communicating pieces.

##<a id="install">Install</a>

Install Go with homebrew doing: `brew install go`.

##<a id="tools">Go Tools</a>

Go comes with a bunch of tools for managing Go code. You can access by typing in `go`. Some of these tools can you help `build` (compile code), `install` packages and dependences and run programs.

###<a id="goget">Go Get</a>

You can get source code by using `go get`.  For example, using `go get golang.org/x/tour/gotour`.

###<a id="goinstall">Go Install</a>

You compile and install packages and dependencies using `go install`.

##<a id="workspace">Workspace Directory Tree</a>

So now you have some code, it should look something like this format:

    bin/
        hello  # an executable file (e.g. $hello) runs the file
    pkg/
        darwin_amd64/
            github.com/
                williamqliu/
                    go-examples  # a package that we made
                        string
                        string.a  # package object
            golang.org  # a package that we got using go get
                x/
                    net/
                    tools/
                    tour/... # goes down further to more package objects
    src/
        github.com/
            williamqliu/
                go-examples/
                    hello/
                        hello.go  # our source code
                        hello_test.go  # test code (must have _test in name)
        golang.org
            ...

##<a id="packages">Packages</a>

Every Go program is made up of packages. Packages start running in package `main`. A sample progam looks like:

    package main
    
    import(
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
    )
    
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
    }

You need the package name as `main` and the func as `main`.  You can have additional functions (e.g. say add), but you also have to define `main`.

A name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.  E.g. if you write a function `Pi` in the `math` package, you can access this as `math.Pi`.

##<a id="samplecode">Sample Code</a>

Okay let's see some sample code already.

    package main
    
    import (
        "fmt"
        "math/rand"
    )
    
    var c, python, java bool  // the 'type' (e.g. bool) goes after the variable name
    var d, e int = 1, 2  // you can initialize variables
    
    const Pi = 3.14  // you can make a constant with =. constants cannot be used with := syntax
    
    func add(x, y int) int {  // same as: x int, y int
        return x + y
    }
    
    func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
        return y, x
    }
    
    func split(sum int) (x, y int) {  // pass in a named variable 'sum'
        x = sum * 4 / 9
        y = sum - x
        return  // a 'naked' return (i.e. no arguments) returns the named values
    }
    
    func main() {
        fmt.Printf("Hello, world\n")  // Default format with Printf
        fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))  // Print line
    
        fmt.Println("These two numbers added together are:", add(42, 13))  // using the 'add' function we made
    
        a, b := swap("First", "Second")  // using the 'swap' function we made
        fmt.Println(a, b)
    
        fmt.Println(split(17))  // using the 'split' function we made
    
        var i int
        fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)  // by default, things are 0 or false (depending on type)
    
        var c, python, java = true, false, "No!"  // you can initialize variables
        fmt.Println(d, e, c, python, java)
    
        k := 3  // a short variable declaration means let Go figure out the type
        fmt.Println(k)
    
        w := 42  // same as: var w int = 42
        x := float64(w)  // doing a type conversion from int to float64, same as: var f float64 = float64(i)
        y := uint(x)  // a uint is a 'byte', same as: var u uint = uint(f)
        z := rune(y)  // a rune is an `int32`, mainly for Unicode code point
        fmt.Println(z)  // If you declare a variable, you have to use it or else it's an error!
        fmt.Println("Pi is", Pi)
    }
