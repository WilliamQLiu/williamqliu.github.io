# Summary

These are my notes from switching to VIM as my main text editor.

## Background on editors (ex, vi)

Unix has a number of editors, including line editors like __ed__ and __ex__
(which display a line of the file on the screen) and screen editors like __vi__
and __Emacs__ (which display a part of the file on your terminal screen).

Text editors based on the X Window System are also available, such as GNU
Emacs, XEmacs, and Vim, allowing multiple X windows. With Vim, you'll sometimes
run `ex` commands by starting with the `:`. Remember that __vi__ is just the
visual mode and __ex__ is the underlying editor.

## Background on terminals

The original version of vi abstracted out the terminal control information from
the code into a text-file database of terminal capabilities managed by the
`termcap` library (similar to the `terminfo` library). In order to tell vi
which terminal you had, you had to set the `TERM` environment variable,
typically done in a shell startup file like a `.profile`.

Today we use terminal emulators that take care of setting the TERM variable.
Typically, terminal emulators still pay attention to __stty__ settings, which
is how you can print terminal line settings.

## Vim tutor

Start vim with `vim`. Type in `:vimtutor` to start the built in vim tutor.

## Bang `!` operator

Vim allows you to execute a command directly from the editor without needing to
drop to a shell by using the **bang** operator followed by the command to run.

For example, `:! wc %` does a word count using the `wc` utility in the current 
file (`%` stands for the file). Note this runs through the file and not the
buffer so make sure to save if you want the latest info.

### Double Bang `!!`

Reruns the last external command with `:!!`

## Files

* `q` to quit
* `q!` to trash all changes
* `w somenewfile` to write/save changes to a new file (from the buffer)
* `w! someexistingfile` to overwrite the existing file
* `wq!` to save and quit

## Modes

Vim has a few different modes that allow different actions.

* Normal Mode / Command Mode is the default mode (keyboard keys issue commands)
* `Ctrl` + `v` to enter Visual mode (allows you to copy lines of text)
* `Ctrl` + `i` to enter Insert Mode (add new text)

### Bottom-Line Commands

Bottom-line commands can start with:

* `/` and `?` to begin search commands
* `:` begins all __ex__ commands (those used by the `ex` line editor)
* `!` starting an `ex` command with an exclamation point gives you access to
  Unix (e.g. `!ls`, `! wc %` to see how many words are in the file)
* `:sh` to drop to the shell or `Ctrl-z` (and return with `fg`)

## 'Operators, Numbers, Motion' Pattern

You combine an operator with a motion, like `dw` to delete a word

* Operator Motion - e.g. `dw` to delete a word, `d$` to delete to end of line
* Operator Number Motion - e.g. d2w to delete two words
* Number Motion - e.g. 2w to move two words
* `ci(` to change inside parenthesis
* Press `.` to repeat the last command

### Operators

Operators are an action like delete.

* `i` to switch to insert mode before cursor (think 'inner')
* `a` to switch to insert mode after cursor (think 'around')
* `A` to append to end of line
* `d` to delete (will need to be followed by an operator like `w` to delete a word, `$` to delete to end of line)
* `c` to change (`cw` to modify that word, `c$` to modify to end of line, `cc`
  to modify entire line)
* `x` to remove a char
* `p` to put back text that was previously deleted
* `r` to replace a single character
* `o` to open a new line below the curosr (then insert mode)
* `O` to open a new line above the cursor (then insert mode)
* `s` to substitute a single character
* `S` subsitutes the entire line (regardless of your current position)
* `~` will change the case of a letter (e.g. upper to lower, vice versa)

### Movement 

So moving is the second piece:

* `h` to move left (can also be followed by a motion)
* `j` to move up (can also be follwoed by a motion)
* `k` to move down (can also be folowed by a motion)
* `l` to move right (can also be folowed by a motion)
* `w` to move to next word (excluding first char); usually use `i` after to write at beginning of word
* `W` to move to next word (determined by whitespace instead of say punctuation for `w`)
* `e` to move to end of current word (including last char); usually use `a` after to write at end of word
* `$` to move to end of the line
* `%` to select every line in the file 
* `0` to move to start of the line
* Shift + `A` to move cursor to end of the line (insert mode)
* Shift + `O` to open a new line above the cursor (insert mode)
* `gg` to move to beginning of document
* `G` to move to end of document
* Number (e.g. 400) + `G` to jump to a line number
* `f` + {char} moves you forward to the first occurrence of that char (from your cursor)
* `F` find char moving back
* `t` moves you forward till the first occurrence of that char (from your
  cursor)
* `T` to move back till the first occurrence of that char
* `+` moves to the first character of next line
* `-` moves to the first character of previous line
* `^` moves to the first nonblank character of current line
* `10 |` moves to column 10 (n) of current line

Note that usually the Capital version of a motion is to move backwards instead
of fowards

### Movement (by Text Blocks)

You can move through text blocks (sentences, paragraphs, sections)

* `(` moves to beginning of the current sentence
* `)` moves to beginning of the next sentence
* `{` moves to beginning of the current paragraph
* `}` moves to beginning of the next paragraph
* `[[` moves to beginning of the current section
* `]]` moves to beginning of the next section

### Movement (Jumps by Screen)

You can move around a little quicker by jumping screens.

* `Ctrl` + `f` to move one screen forward
* `Ctrl` + `b` to move one screen backward
* `Ctrl` + `d` to move half screen forward
* `Ctrl` + `u` to move half screen backward

When you jump screens, you can control where you want the cursor to be.

* `z ENTER` to move current line to top of screen and scroll
* `z .` to move current line to center of screen and scroll
* `z .` to move current line to bottom of screen and scroll
* `zz` to move current line to the middle of the screen
* `zt` to move current line to the top of the screen
* `zb` to move current line to the bottom of the screen

### Movement (To a specific place)

When you open a file with `vim` command, you can specify a line number or
a search pattern.

* `vi +n file` to open a file at line number `n`
* `vi + file` opens file at last line
* `vi +/pattern file` opens file at the first occurrence of the pattern.
* `vi +/"you make" file` opens file at first occurrence of the pattern (you 
  need quotes around a search pattern with whitespace)
* `vi +/you\ make file` opens file at first occurrence of the pattern (you need
  a backslack for whitespace)

## Screen Redraw

You can redraw the screen with `Ctrl + l`.

## Cut, Copy, Paste

Common Cut, Copy, Paste commands

* Every delete is a cut
* `y` to yank (copy) followed by a motion (e.g. `y` + `w` to copy a word)
* `p` to paste right on that line (no new line), can be followed by a motion
* `P` to paste in a new line

If you want to paste a command in Ex, run:

    :<Ctrl> + `r` then followed by `:`

If you're on Ubuntu, make sure you have one of these installed:

    sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
    sudo apt-get install vim-gnome

You can need the +clipboard flag, can check with `echo has('clipboard')`. If 0,
then its not present, 1 it is present

## Undo, Redo

Common Undo, Redo commands. You can undo the most recent command, but you can
also recover most things with undo branches. 

* `u` to undo a single char
* `U` to undo a whole line
* `Ctrl` + `R` to redo changes
* `3p` to restore the third deletion back
* `earlier 10` to move 10 changes backward through the undo tree
* `earlier 1h` to move to changes 1 hour ago
* `earlier 5m` to move to changes 5 minutes ago
* `later 10` to move to the state of the buffer 10 changes later
* `echo changenr()` shows you how many changes are on the undo branch

## Comments

Comment code using the following steps:

### Comment Out

Put in comments

* `Ctrl` + `v` for visual mode
* Select the lines you want
* `I`
* Insert the text you want (e.g. #)

### Uncomment

Remove comments

* `Ctrl` + `v` for visual mode
* Select the lines you want
* Press `d` or `x` to delete chars

## Indent In and Indent Out

To indent in or out, use the following:

* `v` to enter visual mode
* `>>` to indent in (eight spaces by default unless `set shiftwidth` is set))
* `<<` to indent out (eight spaces by default unless `set shiftwidth` is set)

If you want to indent in insert mode (not command mode):

* `Ctrl+t` to create a level of indentation
* `Ctrl+d` to remove a level of indentation

## Multiple Cursors

To insert multiple cursors around columns, use the following:

* `Ctrl` + `v` to select the column(s) you want
* `Shift` + `I` to insert your cursor on all the selected columns, then modify your text
* Once you finish modifying your text, hit '<Esc>' (not Ctrl C) or 'Ctrl + ['
  to Esc

## Messages

Show Messages

* `echom` to echo out to the messages section
* `:messages` to see messages

## Location with Marks

During a vim session, you can mark your place in the file with an invisbile
bookmark. This allows you to perform edits somewhere else, then return to your
marked place.

* Use `m` to set a mark (followed by a-z to set that mark); e.g. `ma` to mark
  buffer a
* `ma` will create a bookmark named `a`, then `'a` to jump back to that bookmark
* `''` will return to the beginning of the line of the previous mark or context
* Use `'` followed by the character to move the cursor to the first character of the line marked;
  e.g. `'a` to return to mark a
* Use ``` (backquote) to go to the character that was marked (e.g. ``a` returns to mark a)
* You can create bookmarks and jump back and forth between files and lines
* You can jump back to the last location you jumped from with `''`
* See `:help jump-motions` for more info on jumping
* You can see what has been marked with `:help marks`
* You can jump between marks with 'ctrl+o' and 'ctrl+i' to move forwards and backwards through your history of jump points
* To see all your marks, type `:marks`

## Ex Editor

So vi is the visual mode of the more general/underlying editor __ex__.
Before vi or other screen editors were invented, line numbers were a way to
identify a part of the file to be worked on. A programmer would print out
a line (or lines) on the printing terminal, give the editing commands to change
just that line, then reprint to check the edited line.

### Why use ex

So why do you want to use ex commands? Normally you won't need to, but if you
want to make changes that affect numerous lines, ex commands might be more
helpful in modifying large blocks of text with a single command.

### Using ex

* `ex somefile` to open a file; you won't see any lines of the file, just how
  many lines are total (e.g. somefile 27L, 575C)
* You enter in a line address followed by a command (e.g. `:1p` to print line
  1, or just enter in the line number) 
* You can enter in ranges of lines (:1,3)
* A command without the line number means only for the current line (to see the
  current line, just run `:ls`)
* To go into vi mode from ex, just run `:vi`

### Editing with ex

These are useful ex commands:

* `d` or `delete` to delete lines
* `m` or `move` to move lines
* `co` or `copy` or `t` to copy lines

Example commands include:

* `:3,18d` to delete lines 3 through 18
* `:160,224m23` to move lines 160 through 224 to line 23
* `:23,29co100` to copy lines 23 through 29 and put after line 100

### Ex Line Addressing Symbols

You can use symbolds for line addresses:

* `.` (dot) stands for the current line
* `$` stands for the last line of the file
* `%` stands for every line in the file
* `+` to address relative lines from current line (forward)
* `-` to address relative lines from current line (behind)

Example commands include:

* `:.,%d` delete from current line to end of the file
* `:20,.m$` to move from line 20 through the current line to the end of the
  file
* `:%d` to delete all the lines in a file (% for all) and `d` to delete
* `%t$` copy all lines and place them at the end of the file

### Combining ex Commands

You don't have to always start an ex command with a colon (`:`). You can also
use the vertical bar `|` as a command separator, which allos you to combine
multiple commands from the same ex prompt (similar to how a semicolon separates
Unix commands at the shell prompt). 

Example:

    # deletes line 1 through 3 (leaving you now on the top line of the file)
    # then make a substitution on the current line (which was line 4 before you
    # invoked the ex prompt)
    :1,3d | s/thier/their/

### Spaces in ex commands

You can use spaces to make commands look cleaner

## Search and Replacement

In Vim, you can do replacements with __global__ (`:g`) and __substitute__ (`:s`).

### Text Search

In Normal mode, type in `/` to start search (going forwards), `?` to search (going backwards)
Vim remebmers your last search.

* `n` to go to next result (going forward)
* `N` to go to next result (going backward)
* `\c` to ignore case for just this search (e.g. `/helloworld\c`)
* `/ ENTER` to repeat the search forward
* `? ENTER` to repeat the search backward

### Current Line Search

If you want to look only at the current line, you can use `f`

* `f somechar` to move to the next occurrence of somechar.
* `F somechar` to move to previous occurrence of somechar
* `t somechar` to move to character before next occurrence of somechar
* `t somechar` to move to character after previous occurrence of somechar
* `;` repeat previous find command in same direction
* `'` repeat previous find command in opposite direction

### Search Operators

* If you want to search for an identifier, say `i`, you can do `/i` to find every
hit (including 'i', 'if', 'while')
* If you want to search by the beginning of the word, use `\<`
* If you want to search by the end of the word, use `\>`
* If you want to search by the beginning and end of the word, use `\<myword\>`
* If you want to see the next occurrence of a search result, press `*`
* To find this or that, use a `\|`, e.g. `red\|green\|blue` will find instances
  of red or green or blue

### Global Searches

You can do a global command `:g` that lets you search for a pattern and display
all lines containing the pattern. You can also use `:!g` to find the opposite of
`:g` (finds all lines that do not match pattern)

Common examples

* `:g/ pattern` finds (and move to) the last occurrence of pattern in the file
* `:g/ pattern /p` finds and displays all lines in the file containing pattern
* `:g/ pattern /nu` finds and displays all lines in the file containing pattern
  (along with line number)
* `:g!/ pattern /nu` finds and displays all lines in the file that does NOT
  contain the pattern (along with line number)

### Substitute

Here's how you can replace one string for another string, one of the simplest
global replacements. This is useful if you mispelled a word.

* `:s/old/new` to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', only first occurrence
  on current line only (`:s` for current line only)
* `:s/old/new/g` to substitute text 'old' with text 'new' on current line only
  (g for all occurrences)
* `:#,#s/old/new/g` to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', only lines # to
  # (g for all occurrences)
* `:%s/old/new/g`to substitute text 'old' with text 'new' every occurrence in file (g for all occurrences)
* `:%s/old/new/gc`to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', globally (every occurrence in file), 
  with `c` to prompt for confirmation

Substitution Tricks

You can run some of these tricks:

* `:s` is the same as `:s//~/`, meaning repeat the last substitution
* `&` key means 'the same thing', as in what you just matched. You can then use:
  `:%&gRepeat the last substitution everywhere` in a command or just press `&`
  to run the last substitution command
* `~` is similar to the `:&` command, except the search pattern used is the
  last regular expression used in ANY command (not just the one used in the
  last substitute command). E.g.
  
  :s/red/blue/
  :/green
  :~

  the `:~` is equivalent to `:s/green/blue/`

### Context-Sensitive Replacement

You can create smarter substitutions with __context-sensitive replacement__.

This syntax lets you search for a pattern and if you found it, then you can
make a substitution.

    # pattern
    :g/pattern/s/old/new/g

    # example
    :g/<keycap>/s/Esc/ESC/g

### Pattern-Matching Rules (Regular Expressions)

When you make global replacements, you can search for __regular expressions__.
In vi, you can use regular expressions in `/` and `?` searches as well as in ex
commands like `:g` and `:s`. For the most part, learning regular expressions is
really useful for other Unix programs like __grep__, __sed__, and __awk__.

Regular expressions are made up of combining normal characters with special
characters called __metacharacters__. Here's a few:

* `.` (period, dot) - matches a __single__ character except a newline
  E.g. `p.p` matches character strings like `pep`, `pip`, `pcp`
* `*` (asterisks) - matches zero or more of the single character that immediately
  follows it. E.g. `bugs*` will match with `bug` (no s), `bugs` (one s),
  `buggsssss` (many s).
* `^` (carrot) - matches the beginning of the line if its used in a regular
  expression. If ^ is not used in a regular expression, it stands for itself.
  E.g. `^Par` matches `Part` or `Parting` since they begin with `Part`. Be
  careful on this since ^ needs to be escaped when you are searching for the
  literal string (i.e., needs `\^`)
* `$` (dollar sign) - matches the end of a regular expression, meaning that the
  text preceding must be found. E.g. `there$` means there must be a sentence
  that ends with the text 'there'.
* `\` (backslash) treates a special character as an ordinary character
  E.g. `\\` means one backslash
* `[]` matches any ONE of the characters enclosed between brackets
  E.g . [AB] matches A or B, [A-Z] matches any A - Z, [0-9] matches any digti
  0-9. Metacharacters lose their special meaning inside brackets so you won't
  need to escape them (except for the special escaping characters below)

Special Escaping

* `-` just note that a hyphen requires special escaping since it could mean
  a range
* `\` requires special escaping since it helps with escaping other characters
* `^` has special meaning when its the first character inside brackets (it
  means reverse the search pattern)
* `]` needs special escaping since it means a range

Advanced Escaping

* `\<` and `\>` matches the beginning (`\<`) or the end (`\>`) of a word.
  E.g. You want to find only the word 'child' and not 'childish', you can
  specify `\<child\>`. These do not have to be used in pairs.
* `\(` and `\)` places anything enclosed in a special holding space (aka
  a __hold buffer__).
  E.g. `:%s/\(That\) or \(this\)/\2 or \1/
  This will save 'That' in hold buffer number 1 and save 'this' in hold buffer
  number 2. The patterns can be replayed in substitutions by the sequences \1
  through \9. The above will rephrase 'That or this' to read 'this or That'.
* `~` matches the regular expression used in the last search

### Folder Search

To search through different files and folders, use `:grep`, `vimgrep`, or
`find`:

* `grep -R 'stuff' .`
* `grep -in 'stuff' .` to show line number and case insensitive
* `find stuff` (e.g. a file)

### Matching Parenthesis Search

`%` on an open parenthesis to jump to its matching pair: (), [], {}

### Jump to matching <div>

To jump to a matching div:

* `v` for visual mode
* `at` for outer tag block
* `it` for inner tag block

## Settings

Permanent settings can be added to a vimrc file in ~/.vimrc
You can `set {variable}` to toggle on or `set no{variable}` to toggle off (or toggle with `set {variable}!`)
You can check the current setting with `?`, like `set no{variable}?`

* `set number` to show line numbers
* `set ruler` to show ruler at bottom right hand corner
* `set ic` to ignore case
* `set hlsearch` to highlight searches (and `noh` to no longer highlight)
* `set incsearch`
* `set nocp` for no compatibility mode

## Mapping Keys

When you're editing, you might want to use a command sequence frequently or
save it to be used later. We do this using the `map` command.

Note that certain keys are unmappable (e.g. ENTER, ESC, BACKSPACE, DELETE)

## Map Command

* `:map x sequence` - defines the character x as a sequence of editing commands
* `:unmap x` - unmaps the character from the command sequence 
* `:map` to list the characters that are currently mapped

### Non Recursive Map

Always use `nnoremap` to avoid recursive mapping; never use the below `map` (more of just an FYI)

* You can map keys using `map` {newchars} {command}, e.g. `:map \ dd` to map \ to delete
* There are variations to map depending on mode (`nmap, `vmap`, `imap`); normal, visual, insert
* `<c-d>` to represent Control + d.
* Make sure to use nonrecursive mapping so you don't end up with recursive
  functions (i.e. each `*map` command has a `*noremap` that you should use)

### Leader

Vim has a prefix called the 'leader'.

* `:let mapleader = ','` to make comma a mapleader
* `:nnoremap <leader>d dd` to make a custom command that starts with leader
* `:let maplocalleader = '\\'` is the same idea, but lets you use `<localleader>`

## Code Completion and Command Completion

### Command Completion

If you want to complete a command:

* Start typing in a command (e.g. `:e`) then press`Ctrl` + `d` to see all options
* `Tab` to complete
* Make sure to `set nocp`

### Code Completion

You can do code completion using:

* `Ctrl` + `n` to do code completion for JUST this file
* `Ctrl` + `P` for code completion on ALL files
* `Ctrl` + `x` and `Ctrl` + `f` to find by filenames
* `find <full-file-name-including-extension>`

## Documentation

You can see documentation with:

* Select field or function
* `K` to display documentation

## External Commands

`!` followed by an external command to run an external command
* `!ls` to show current listing directory

## Status Bar

* `Ctrl` + `g` to show the current file pathname and file info like number of lines

## Files

You can use vim to edit files and vim copies these files into a __buffer__,
an area temporarily set aside in memory. When you save your edits, vi copies
the buffer back into a permanetn file.

### Saving / Writing to Files

You can save files with `:w`

* `:w file1` to write to file1
* You might use by highlighting text in Visual mode, then do `:w file1`

### Appending to a Saved File

You can append to a saved file with

    # the file 'newfile' would have the lines 340 to the end of the buffer
    # appended to it
    :340,$w >> newfile

### Reading from Files

* `:r file1` to read from file1
* You might use by reading text from file and outputting to your current file
* Other uses might be `:r !ls` to read in from external command (e.g. list directory)
* `vim -R file` or `view file` to open the file in read-only mode; use `w!` or
  `wq` to override read-only mode to write

### Editing Files

* You can edit files with `:e`
* Since it's common to switch between two files, you can use `:n` to switch
  between the current and alternate filenames.

Current and Alternate Filenames

* The __current filename__ can be referred to with `%`
* The __alternate filename__ can be referred to with `#`

You can then say `:r #` to read the alternate file or say `:e #` to edit the
alternate file.

### Recover Files

When you edit the buffer and a file crashes, you can try to recover it with
`vim -r somefile`. If you want to save the command, use `:pre` (`:preserve`).
This might be useful if you made edits to a file and found out later you don't
have permissions to write.

## Help

`help` + optional command


## Windows

* `wincmd1`for all of the windows commands where you see `Ctrl` + `W`
* `Ctrl` + `W` to switch windows

### Splitting Windows

* `:split` to split windows (two horizontal windows), also `:vsplit` to split to vertical windows
* `:close` to close current window, also `:only` to close all other windows except the current focused one
* `:split file1` to open a separate file
* `:new` to open a new file (as top-bottom windows), also `vnew` or `vertical new` (side by side)

### Window Size

Window size can be adjusted by dragging the mouse over the status bar or by the below commands:

* `Ctrl` + `W` + `+` or `-` to increase or decrease window size
* `{height}` + `Ctrl` + `_` to set window height to specific line size
* `Ctrl` + `W` + `_` to increase window size as high as possible
* You can set settings for `winminheight`, `winminwidth`, `equalalways` option

### Moving Windows

* `Ctrl` + `W`, then either `H`, `J`, `K`, `L` (note: has to be capital)

### Exiting Windows

* `qall` to quit all windows (quit all)
* `wall` to save all windows (write all)
* `wqall` to quit and save all windows (quit, write all)
* `qall!` to quit all windows and throw away all changes`

### Cleaning swap files

To clean out the .swp files:

* `vim file1`

## Diff

You can diff using `vimdiff` (outside vim, in the shell) or inside vim

### Vimdiff

To see differences between two files, start vim in `vimdiff` mode; type in shell (NOT in vim)

* `vimdiff oldfile newfile`
* `set noscrollbind` if you don't want both windows to scroll the same
* You will see folds (diffs in code), can be opened and closed with `zo` (open) and `zc` (close)

### Diff inside Vim

* `edit newfile`
* `vertical diffsplit oldfile`, if you do not put in `vertical`, default is `horizontal`

### Jumping Between Changes

* `]c` to move to next change
* `[c` to move to previous change

## Buffers

When you're editing a file, deletes and yanks are saved in a buffer (a place in
stored memory).

### Idea behind Buffers (from vim help)

Summary:
   A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
   A window is a viewport on a buffer.
   A tab page is a collection of windows.

A window is a viewport onto a buffer.  You can use multiple windows on one
buffer, or several windows on different buffers.

A buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing. The original file remains
unchanged until you write the buffer to the file.

Buffers can have three states:
* active-buffer ('a'): buffer displayed in a window; filed been read in, buffer might have changed and diff than file
* hidden-buffer ('h'): buffer is not displayed in a window; otherwise same as active-buffer
* inactive-buffer (' '): buffer is not displayed and does not contain anything

### Buffer Commands

* `:ls` or `buffers` to list current buffers, active one has '%' symbol, will show buffer state ('a', 'h', ' ')
* `:bdelete {Number}` (or `:bd {Number}`) to delete a specific buffer

### Navigating Buffers

* `:b <substring>` lets you type in a substring (say index) and if unique from buffers open, will switch to that
* `:bnext` (or `:bn`) to go to next buffer (added remap to `[b`)
* `:bprev` (or `:bp`) to go to previous buffer (added remap to `]b`)
* `:bfirst` (or `:bf`) to go to first buffer in list (added remap to `[B`)
* `:blast` (or `:bl`) to go to last buffer in list (added remap to `]B`)
* `:b#` to switch to last seen buffer
* `:buffer {Number}` to go to buffer number
* You can also use `<Ctrl> + ^` to switch back to the previous file

### Last 9 Deletes

Your last nine deletes are saved in numbered buffers (last delete in 1,
second-to-last in 2, etc). To recover a deletion, type in `"` (double quote)
followed by the number representing your delete, then `p` to put.

E.g. `"2p` will place what is in the second deletion buffer

If you want to keep pasting what is next in the buffer, use the `.` command to
repeat (will autoincrement to the next buffer).

### Named Buffers

You can also yank (`y`) or delete (`d`) with a set of 26 named buffers (a-z).

`"dyy` will yank the current line into buffer d
`"a7yy` will yank the next 7 levels into buffer a
`"dP` will put the contents of buffer d before the cursor
`"ap` will put the contents of buffer a after the cursor

## Tabs

Tabs can be created or deleted by the GUI (+) and (x) signs or by text:

* `:tabedit file1` to create or open a tab
* `gt` is go to next tab
* `gT` is go back a tab
* `tab split` to open up another tab with same text

For my vimrc, I like using these shortcuts:

    nnoremap tn :tabnew<Space>
    nnoremap tk :tabnext<CR>
    nnoremap tj :tabprev<CR>
    nnoremap th :tabfirst<CR>
    nnoremap tl :tablast<CR>

## Tags

A good way to navigate around a bunch of code references is through ctags.

* `brew install ctags` to first install ctags
* `ctags -R .` to recursively create links for the tags file, will appear as 'tags'
* `Ctrl` + `O` to open up the definition
* `Ctrl` + `t` to go back
* With a plugin (e.g. vim-tags), you can generate with `:TagsGenerate` and `:TagsGenerate!` to refresh

Look up CScope for a more powerful setup to see additional info beyond function definition (e.g. calls that function)

## Macros

Macros are useful when you want to perform the same action over many lines.
What we're doing is saving commands in named buffers. An example of when to use 
a macro might be to delete everything after the `:`

    key_values = {
        'key1': 'value1',
        'key2': 'value2',
        'key3': 'value3',
        'key4': 'value4'
    }

Macros follow the pattern:

    q<letter><commands>q

* Press `q` and a letter (a - z) representing the register. Normally I use `qq`
to start recording to register q.
* I enter my commands, then hit `q` again to
quit.
* I run the macro with `@q` (since I recorded the macro to `q`.
* To view what is in your registers, type `:registers`

Note on Macros:

Since `@` is interpreted as a vi command, a dot (`.`) will repeat the entire
sequence

### Executing Buffers from Ex

You can execute text saved in a buffer from ex mode.

Example:

O'Reilly Media publishes great books.
O'Reilly Media is my favorite publisher.

1.) With your cursor on the last line, delete the command into the 'g' buffer with
`"gdd`
2.) Now you should have that last line in your buffer (can check with `:reg`
and see `"g`)
3.) Then execute the buffer from the colon command line `:@g` and ENTER.

## Vimscripting

### `!` and `?` options

You can toggle options with `!`.

* `:set number!` will toggle whether line numbers display
* `:set number?` will show if the option number is set
* `:set path?` will show what the current path is set to
* `:set nonumber?` will show if the option number is set
* `:set wrap?`

### Autocmd

You can tell Vim to run certain commands whenever certain events happen with
`autocmd`. For example, this tells vim to create files as soon as you edit
them.

    :autocmd BufNewFile * :write

    # BufNewFile is the 'event' to watch for
    # * is the 'pattern' to filter the event
    # :write is the command to run

Other examples are:

    # Anytime you read or create a new file that is .html, use these settings
    :autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.html setlocal nowrap

    # If certain filetype, then use these mappings
    :autocmd FileType javascript nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I//<esc>
    :autocmd FileType python     nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I#<esc> 

## Reading Command Output

You can read from a file and insert into your current vim file with `:r`.
Examples include:

* `:r textfile` read in text from afile into the current buffer
* `:r ! lx -l ~` Read in the output of a shell application

## Ctags

The source code for a large C, C++ program will usually be spread over several
files. A Unix command called __ctags__ can be used together with the `:tag`
command in vi. 

### Creating the Ctags file __tags__

You run the __ctags__ command at the Unix command line; this creates an
information file that vi can use later to determine which files define
which functions. By default, the file created is called __tags__. From vi, run
the command `:!ctags file.c`

### Using __tags__

If you want to edit a function in the program, but do not know where the
function is, then you can run the command: `:tag myname` so you can read in the
file and find which file contains the definition of the function 'myname' and
move the cursor over to the first line

    def myname():
        print "Hello"

You can also do a tag look up with `^]`.


### Vim benefits over vi

* multiwindow editing (can edit a different file in each window)
* GUI interfaces
* extended regular expressions
* enchanced tags
