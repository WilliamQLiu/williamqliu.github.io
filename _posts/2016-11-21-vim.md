# Summary

These are my notes from switching to VIM as my main text editor.

## Vim tutor

Start vim with `vim`. Type in `:vimtutor` to start the built in vim tutor.

## Files

* `q` to quit
* `q!` to trash all changes
* `w` to save changes
* `wq!` to save and quit

## Modes

Vim has a few different modes that allow different actions.

* Normal Mode is default mode
* `Ctrl` + `v` to enter visual mode (allows you to copy lines of text)
* `Ctrl` + `i` to enter Insert Mode (add new text)
* `Ctrl` + `R` to enter Replace Mode (like insert mode, but replaces existing text)

## 'Operators, Numbers, Motion' Pattern

You combine an operator with a motion, like `dw` to delete a word

* Operator Motion - e.g. `dw` to delete a word, `d$` to delete to end of line
* Operator Number Motion - e.g. d2w to delete two words
* Number Motion - e.g. 2w to move two words
* `ci(` to change inside parenthesis
* Press `.` to repeat the last command

### Operators

Operators are an action like delete.

* `i` to switch to insert mode before cursor (think 'inner')
* `a` to switch to insert mode after cursor (think 'around')
* `A` to append to end of line
* `d` to delete (will need to be followed by an operator like `w` to delete a word, `$` to delete to end of line)
* `c` to change (`cw` to modify that word, `c$` to modify to end of line)
* `x` to remove a char
* `p` to put back text that was previously deleted
* `r` to replace a single character
* `o` to open a new line below the curosr (then insert mode)
* `O` to open a new line above the cursor (then insert mode)

### Motion

So moving is the second piece:

* `h` to move left (can also be followed by a motion)
* `j` to move up (can also be follwoed by a motion)
* `k` to move down (can also be folowed by a motion)
* `l` to move right (can also be folowed by a motion)
* `w` to move to next word (excluding first char); usually use `i` after to write at beginning of word
* `W` to move to next word (determined by whitespace instead of say punctuation for `w`)
* `e` to move to end of current word (including last char); usually use `a` after to write at end of word
* Shift + `$` to move to end of the line
* `0` to move to start of the line
* Shift + `A` to move cursor to end of the line (insert mode)
* Shift + `O` to open a new line above the cursor (insert mode)
* `gg` to move to beginning of document
* `G` to move to end of document
* `Ctrl` + `f` to move large jump forward
* `Ctrl` + `b` to move large jump backward
* Number (e.g. 400) + `G` to jump to a line number
* `f` + {char} moves you forward to the first occurrence of that char (from your cursor)
* `F` find char moving back
* `t` moves you forward till the first occurrence of that char (from your
  cursor)
* `T` to move back till the first occurrence of that char

Note that usually the Capital version of a motion is to move backwards instead
of fowards

## Cut, Copy, Paste

Common Cut, Copy, Paste commands

* Every delete is a cut
* `y` to yank (copy) followed by a motion (e.g. `y` + `w` to copy a word)
* `p` to paste right on that line (no new line), can be followed by a motion
* `P` to paste in a new line

If you're on Ubuntu, make sure you have one of these installed:

    sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
    sudo apt-get install vim-gnome

You can need the +clipboard flag, can check with `echo has('clipboard')`. If 0,
then its not present, 1 it is present

## Undo, Redo

Common Undo, Redo commands

* `u` to undo a single char
* `U` to undo a whole line
* `Ctrl` + `R` to redo changes

## Comments

Comment code using the following steps:

### Comment Out

Put in comments

* `Ctrl` + `v` for visual mode
* Select the lines you want
* `I`
* Insert the text you want (e.g. #)

### Uncomment

Remove comments

* `Ctrl` + `v` for visual mode
* Select the lines you want
* Press `d` or `x` to delete chars

## Indent In and Indent Out

To indent in or out, use the following:

* `v` to enter visual mode
* `>` to indent in
* `<` to indent out

## Multiple Cursors

To insert multiple cursors around columns, use the following:

* `Ctrl` + `v` to select the column(s) you want
* `Shift` + `I` to insert your cursor on all the selected columns, then modify your text
* Once you finish modifying your text, hit '<Esc>' (not Ctrl C) or 'Ctrl + ['
  to Esc

## Messages

Show Messages

* `echom` to echo out to the messages section
* `:messages` to see messages

## Location with Marks

* `Ctrl` + `g` to show the current file pathname and file info like number of lines
* Use `m` to set a mark (followed by a-z to set that mark)
* Use ``` to go to the mark (e.g. ``a` returns to mark a)
* You can create bookmarks and jump back and forth between files and lines
  * `ma` will create a bookmark named `a`, then `'a` to jump back to that bookmark
* You can jump back to the last location you jumped from with `''`
* See `:help jump-motions` for more info on jumping
* You can see what has been marked with `:help marks`
* You can jump between marks with 'ctrl+o' and 'ctrl+i' to move forwards and backwards through your history of jump points


## Search

### Text Search

In Normal mode, type in `/` to start search (going forwards), `?` to search (going backwards)

* `n` to go to next result (going forward)
* `N` to go to next result (going backward)
* `\c` to ignore case for just this search (e.g. `/helloworld\c`)

### Search Operators

* If you want to search for an identifier, say `i`, you can do `/i` to find every
hit (including 'i', 'if', 'while')
* If you want to search by the beginning of the word, use `\<`
* If you want to search by the end of the word, use `\>`
* If you want to search by the beginning and end of the word, use `\<myword\>`
* If you want to see the next occurence of a search result, press `*`
* To find this or that, use a `\|`, e.g. `red\|green\|blue` will find instances
  of red or green or blue

### Folder Search

To search through different files and folders, use `:grep` or `vimgrep`

* `grep -R 'stuff' .`
* `grep -in 'stuff' .` to show line number and case insensitive
* `find stuff` (e.g. a file)

### Matching Parenthesis Search

`%` on an open parenthesis to jump to its matching pair: (), [], {}

### Jump to matching <div>

To jump to a matching div:

* `v` for visual mode
* `at` for outer tag block
* `it` for inner tag block

## Substitute

* `:s/old/new` to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', only first occurrence
* `:s/old/new/g` to substitute text 'old' with text 'new' on current line only
* `:#,#s/old/new/g` to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', only lines # to #
* `:%s/old/new/g`to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', globally (every occurrence in file)
* `:%s/old/new/gc`to substitute text 'old' with text 'new', globally (every occurrence in file), with prompt

## Settings

Permanent settings can be added to a vimrc file in ~/.vimrc
You can `set {variable}` to toggle on or `set no{variable}` to toggle off (or toggle with `set {variable}!`)
You can check the current setting with `?`, like `set no{variable}?`

* `set number` to show line numbers
* `set ruler` to show ruler at bottom right hand corner
* `set ic` to ignore case
* `set hlsearch` to highlight searches (and `noh` to no longer highlight)
* `set incsearch`
* `set nocp` for no compatibility mode

## Mapping Keys

### Non Recursive Map

Always use `nnoremap` to avoid recursive mapping; never use the below `map` (more of just an FYI)

* You can map keys using `map` {newchars} {command}, e.g. `:map \ dd` to map \ to delete
* There are variations to map depending on mode (`nmap, `vmap`, `imap`); normal, visual, insert
* `<c-d>` to represent Control + d.
* Make sure to use nonrecursive mapping so you don't end up with recursive
  functions (i.e. each `*map` command has a `*noremap` that you should use)

### Leader

Vim has a prefix called the 'leader'.

* `:let mapleader = ','` to make comma a mapleader
* `:nnoremap <leader>d dd` to make a custom command that starts with leader
* `:let maplocalleader = '\\'` is the same idea, but lets you use `<localleader>`

## Code Completion and Command Completion

### Command Completion

If you want to complete a command:

* Start typing in a command (e.g. `:e`) then press`Ctrl` + `d` to see all options
* `Tab` to complete
* Make sure to `set nocp`

### Code Completion

You can do code completion using:

* `Ctrl` + `n` to do code completion for JUST this file
* `Ctrl` + `P` for code completion on ALL files
* `Ctrl` + `x` and `Ctrl` + `f` to find by filenames
* `find <full-file-name-including-extension>`

## Documentation

You can see documentation with:

* Select field or function
* `K` to display documentation

## External Commands

`!` followed by an external command to run an external command
* `!ls` to show current listing directory

## Files

### Writing to Files

* `:w file1` to write to file1
* You might use by highlighting text in Visual mode, then do `:w file1`

### Reading from Files

* `:r file1` to read from file1
* You might use by reading text from file and outputting to your current file
* Other uses might be `:r !ls` to read in from external command (e.g. list directory)

## Help

`help` + optional command

## Windows

* `wincmd1`for all of the windows commands where you see `Ctrl` + `W`
* `Ctrl` + `W` to switch windows
* Plugins allow `Ctrl` + movement (e.g. hjkl) since I'm a goof and sometimes press `Cmd` + `w` to quit

### Splitting Windows

* `:split` to split windows (two horizontal windows), also `:vsplit` to split to vertical windows
* `:close` to close current window, also `:only` to close all other windows except the current focused one
* `:split file1` to open a separate file
* `:new` to open a new file (as top-bottom windows), also `vnew` or `vertical new` (side by side)

### Window Size
Window size can be adjusted by dragging the mouse over the status bar or by the below commands:

* `Ctrl` + `W` + `+` or `-` to increase or decrease window size
* `{height}` + `Ctrl` + `_` to set window height to specific line size
* `Ctrl` + `W` + `_` to increase window size as high as possible
* You can set settings for `winminheight`, `winminwidth`, `equalalways` option

### Moving Windows

* `Ctrl` + `W`, then either `H`, `J`, `K`, `L` (note: has to be capital)

### Exiting Windows

* `qall` to quit all windows (quit all)
* `wall` to save all windows (write all)
* `wqall` to quit and save all windows (quit, write all)
* `qall!` to quit all windows and throw away all changes`

### Cleaning swap files
To clean out the .swp files:

* `vim file1`

## Diff

You can diff using `vimdiff` (outside vim, in the shell) or inside vim

### Vimdiff

To see differences between two files, start vim in `vimdiff` mode; type in shell (NOT in vim)

* `vimdiff oldfile newfile`
* `set noscrollbind` if you don't want both windows to scroll the same
* You will see folds (diffs in code), can be opened and closed with `zo` (open) and `zc` (close)

### Diff inside Vim

* `edit newfile`
* `vertical diffsplit oldfile`, if you do not put in `vertical`, default is `horizontal`

## Jumping Between Changes

* `]c` to move to next change
* `[c` to move to previous change

## Buffers

### Idea behind Buffers (from vim help)

Summary:
   A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
   A window is a viewport on a buffer.
   A tab page is a collection of windows.

A window is a viewport onto a buffer.  You can use multiple windows on one
buffer, or several windows on different buffers.

A buffer is a file loaded into memory for editing. The original file remains
unchanged until you write the buffer to the file.

Buffers can have three states:
* active-buffer ('a'): buffer displayed in a window; filed been read in, buffer might have changed and diff than file
* hidden-buffer ('h'): buffer is not displayed in a window; otherwise same as active-buffer
* inactive-buffer (' '): buffer is not displayed and does not contain anything

### Buffer Commands

* `:ls` or `buffers` to list current buffers, active one has '%' symbol, will show buffer state ('a', 'h', ' ')
* `:bdelete {Number}` (or `:bd {Number}`) to delete a specific buffer

### Navigating Buffers

* `:b <substring>` lets you type in a substring (say index) and if unique from buffers open, will switch to that
* `:bnext` (or `:bn`) to go to next buffer (added remap to `[b`)
* `:bprev` (or `:bp`) to go to previous buffer (added remap to `]b`)
* `:bfirst` (or `:bf`) to go to first buffer in list (added remap to `[B`)
* `:blast` (or `:bl`) to go to last buffer in list (added remap to `]B`)
* `:b#` to switch to last seen buffer
* `:buffer {Number}` to go to buffer number

## Tabs

Tabs can be created or deleted by the GUI (+) and (x) signs or by text:

* `:tabedit file1` to create or open a tab
* `gt` is go to next tab
* `gT` is go back a tab
* `tab split` to open up another tab with same text

##Tags
A good way to navigate around a bunch of code references is through ctags.

* `brew install ctags` to first install ctags
* `ctags -R .` to recursively create links for the tags file, will appear as 'tags'
* `Ctrl` + `O` to open up the definition
* `Ctrl` + `t` to go back
* With a plugin (e.g. vim-tags), you can generate with `:TagsGenerate` and `:TagsGenerate!` to refresh

Look up CScope for a more powerful setup to see additional info beyond function definition (e.g. calls that function)

## Macros

Macros are useful when you want to perform the same action over many lines. An
example of when to use a macro might be to delete everything after the `:`

    key_values = {
        'key1': 'value1',
        'key2': 'value2',
        'key3': 'value3',
        'key4': 'value4'
    }

Macros follow the pattern:

    q<letter><commands>q

* Press `q` and a letter (a - z) representing the register. Normally I use `qq`
to start recording to register q.
* I enter my commands, then hit `q` again to
quit.
* I run the macro with `@q` (since I recorded the macro to `q`.
* To view what is in your registers, type `:registers`

## Vimscripting

### `!` and `?` options

You can toggle options with `!`.

* `:set number!` will toggle whether line numbers display
* `:set number?` will show if the option number is set
* `:set path?` will show what the current path is set to (usually used with
  `set path=$PWD/**` to set path to current working dir)
* `:set nonumber?` will show if the option number is set
* `:set wrap?`

### Autocmd

You can tell Vim to run certain commands whenever certain events happen with
`autocmd`. For example, this tells vim to create files as soon as you edit
them.

    :autocmd BufNewFile * :write

    # BufNewFile is the 'event' to watch for
    # * is the 'pattern' to filter the event
    # :write is the command to run

Other examples are:

    # Anytime you read or create a new file that is .html, use these settings
    :autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.html setlocal nowrap

    # If certain filetype, then use these mappings
    :autocmd FileType javascript nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I//<esc>
    :autocmd FileType python     nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I#<esc>
