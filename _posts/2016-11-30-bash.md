#Summary

These are notes for shell scripting, specifically for Bash, (aka the Bourne-Again shell, a replacement for the Bourne shell). At its heart, a bash script is just a list of system commands stored in a file.

##<a id="shellsprofiles">Shells and Profiles</a>

Shells and Profiles go hand in hand. The idea is that when our shell starts up (and depending on how it starts up), it looks at our profiles for different settings.

###<a id="shells">Shells</a>

First off, there's a lot of different shells. By default, most systems use the Bash shell. There's others like `csh`, `zsh`, `sh`) 
Now you also have a lot of different profiles; you have your `.bash_profile`, your `.profile`, your `etc/bash.bashrc`. What is going on?!


1. When you start bash as an **interactive login shell**, bash reads and executes from `/etc/profile` (if it exists, which it does on a Mac).
2. Often this startup script calls other files, like `/etc/bash.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login` and `~/.profile`. It uses the first one that exists and is readable.
3. When a bash login shell exits, it reads `~/.bash_logout` (if it exists).


###<a id="profiles">Profiles</a>

So what's the difference between say `.bash_profile` and `.profile`? Bash profile is specific to bash while profile is used for more generic shells (e.g. not dependent on the bash shell)
Remember how I said depending how your shell starts up? Besides the interactive login shell, you can also start as a non-login interactive shell; this then reads `.bashrc` and does NOT read `.bash_profile`
I use bash so it doesn't matter if I put customizations in `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`, but you should be aware of this if you do use other shells.

##<a id="basics">Basics</a>

###<a id="shabang">! the sha-bang</a>

You need to include the `!` (sha-bang) in order to invoke the script

* `#!/bin/bash` goes at the beginning of the file and tells your system that this file is a set of commands to be fed to the command interpreter indicated
* Here we have `#!`, a *magic number*, a special marker that designates a file type (an executable shell script)
* We then have a file path, the `/bin/bash` that points to the shell location (note: /bin is where we keep a lot of other ready to run programs like `echo`, `kill`)

###<a id="comments">Comments</a>
`#` to start a line off with comments or you can put after code
You cannot put code after a comment

###<a id="variables">Variables</a>
You can assign values to variables.

* Variables have no data types
* No `$` is used when doing assignment, e.g. `STR="Hello world!"`
*  `$` is used when referencing a variable, e.g. `echo $STR`
* `local` to create a local variable (e.g. in a function) like `local STR="HELLO"`

##<a id="processmanagement">Process Management with ; and &</a>

The bash shell can run commands using two ways, batch (Unix) and concurrent mode

###<a id="batchmode">; as batch mode </a>

You can put more than one command on the same line, just use a ; (semicolon) to separate commands. ; runs commands one after another

    echo hello; echo there

###<a id="concurrentmode">& for concurrent mode</a>

You can put more than one command on the same line, just use a & to separate commands. & runs commands concurrently

    echo hello & echo there

##<a id="controlflow">Control Flow</a>

You can control the flow of bash scripts with `if`, `case`, and `select` statements.

###<a id="if">if statement</a>

You can run specify if statements with the syntax:

    if TEST-COMMANDS; then CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; fi

####if example

    if [ TEST-COMMANDS -ne 0 ]
      then
        echo "TEST"
    fi

####if example with last command

    if [ $? - eq 0 ] 
      then echo "Last command exited successfully"
    fi

###<a id="case">case statements</a>

`case` is a switch statement

###<a id="select">select statements</a>

`select` creates a prompt (`$PS3`, by default) and allows user to select from a prompt

####select example

    #!/bin/bash
    PS3='Choose your favorite vegetable: '
    select vegetable in "beans" "carrots" "potatoes" "onions" "rutabagas"
    do
      echo
      echo "Your favorite beggie is $vegetable"
      break
    done
    exit

####select in a function example

    #!/bin/bash
    PS3='Choose your favorite vegetable: '
    echo
    choice_of()
    {
    select vegetable
    # [in list] omitted, so 'select' uses arguments passed to the function
    do
      echo
      echo "Your favorite veggie is $vegetable."
      break
    done
    }

    choice_of beans rice carrots radishes rutabaga spinach
    exit 0
