#Summary

Notes from learning Blender

##Navigation

By default, there will be a camera, a light, and a cube object.

###Navigation around 3D space (using the View Port)

You can move around using Blender's View Port using these movement options.

* Shift + Middle Mouse Button to pan
* Middle Mouse Click and drag to look around
* Scroll in/out to zoom in/out

###Interacting with objects

You can select an object (will see an orange selection) and then you can move the object around a scene.
There should be an X, Y, Z that you can then move across.

##Shortcuts

`n` for toggling properties tab of an object
`z` for toggling wireframe mode
`g` for moving object freely
`s` for scaling object freely

##Modes

* Tab to toggle **Edit Mode** and **Object Mode**
