# Summary

Notes on Devops systems, including VirtualBox, Vagrant, Ansible, Docker. Installation instructions for Mac.

## Vagrant and VirtualBox

Vagrant helps create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.

VirtualBox is separate, but often goes with Vagrant because its virtualization for hardware (usually for servers).

### Setup Vagrant and Virtualbox

Install with Homebrew's Cask.

* `brew cask install virtualbox`
* `brew cask install vagrant`
* `brew cask install vagrant-manager`

### Vagrant Useful Commands

Useful commands include:

`vagrant init centos/7` to initialize vagrant with centos/7 box, with boxes that can be found at hashicorp
`vagrant up` to bring vagrant up and running
`vagrant box add centos/7` to add a box
`vagrant ssh` to ssh into the machine
`vagrant reload --provision` to provision the server

### Vagrantfile

Wherever you did the init with Vagrant is your root directory. You should see a hidden `.vagrant` directory and a Vagrantfile.

You can configure the Vagrantfile, e.g. setup the provisioning like:

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
      config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
        ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
      end
    end

## Ansible

**Ansible** helps automate provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment using an agentless architecture.

Ansible does this by setting up **playbooks** that contain **plays**, **tasks** and **handlers**. We can also assign **roles** and **variables**.

###Installing Ansible

Install Ansible with `pip install ansible` (will also install other libraries).

### Inventory File

Inventory Files are just lists of hosts. Check what hosts are available with `ansible all -m ping`.

* Depending on your local setup, the hosts file might be in `/etc/ansible/hosts` or `/usr/local/etc/ansible/hosts`
* You can specify where to look for the hosts with an environment variable: `export ANSIBLE_INVENTORY=~/ansible_hosts`

Here's a sample inventory file (has an INI-like format):

    mail.jobwaffle.com:5309

    [webservers]
    foo.jobwaffle.com
    bar.jobwaffle.com

    [dbservers]
    db1.jobwaffle.com
    db2.jobwaffle.com 

### Run ad-hoc Ansible commands

With just an inventory file, you can run one off ansible commands directly like:

* `ansible all -a /bin/date`
* `ansible all -m ping`

### Playbooks

**Playbooks** declare configurations, orchestrate steps across machines, and launch tasks (asynchronously and synchronously).

* Playbooks are setup in YAML format with one or more **plays** per playbook.
* The goal is to map a group of **hosts** to some well defined roles, represented as **tasks**.
* Run playbooks with `ansible-playbook site.yml` where **site.yml** is the playbook.

### Hosts and Users

**Hosts** determine which machines to target (e.g. dbservers, webservers). This is marked by `hosts: something`
**Roles** (aka **Users**) determine which role or user to run as executing a task (e.g. root). This is marked by say `remote_user: root`

Example Usage:

    ---
    - hosts: webservers
      remote_user: root

### Tasks

Each play contains a list of tasks that are executed in order, one at a time.

* Tasks will be run if matched by **hosts**
* Each task should idempotent (i.e. run multiple times and no effect if already ran)
* Each task should have a **name** that describes what the script is doing

### Handlers

Playbooks have a basic event system that can respond to change only once; this system is called **handlers** and they are called by other plays. Handlers are triggered by **tasks**

An example handler might be to restart httpd:

    handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      service: name=httpd state=restarted
