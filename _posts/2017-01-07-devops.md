#Summary

Notes on Devops systems, including VirtualBox, Vagrant, Ansible, Docker. Installation instructions for Mac.

##Vagrant and VirtualBox

Vagrant helps create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.

VirtualBox is separate, but often goes with Vagrant because its virtualization for hardware (usually for servers).

###Setup Vagrant and Virtualbox

Install with Homebrew's Cask.

* `brew cask install virtualbox`
* `brew cask install vagrant`
* `brew cask install vagrant-manager`

###Vagrant Useful Commands

Useful commands include:

`vagrant init centos/7` to initialize vagrant with centos/7 box, with boxes that can be found at hashicorp
`vagrant up` to bring vagrant up and running
`vagrant box add centos/7` to add a box
`vagrant ssh` to ssh into the machine
`vagrant reload --provision` to provision the server

###Vagrantfile

Wherever you did the init with Vagrant is your root directory. You should see a hidden `.vagrant` directory and a Vagrantfile.

You can configure the Vagrantfile, e.g. setup the provisioning like:

    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
      config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
        ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
      end
    end

##Docker

Docker is an open platform to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Docker consists of Docker Engine, a lightweight runtime and packaging tool that is made up of:

* A daemon (aka server); a server process that manages all the containers
* Clients act as a remote control for the daemon. Clients talk to the docker server/daemon
* Images are the building blocks of Docker, think of it like the source code for your containers. Images are built by adding a file, running a command, opening a port. Example images include Nginx or Postgresql database.
* Containers are launched from images and can contain one or more running processes. A Docker container is:
    * An image format (think of this as the cargo)
    * A set of standard operations (think of it as what it can do with the cargo, e.g. create, start, stop, restart, destroy)
    * An execution environment (think of it as where to ship your container; can build on laptop, deploy to EC2 instance)

The goal of Docker is to enable apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between different environments (dev, QA, production).

##Setup Docker

Setup for a Mac.

###Docker

* Docker Engine, can check with `docker --version`
* Compose, can check with `docker-compose --version`
* Machine, can check with `docker-machine --version`

##Docker General Commands

* `docker` to get a list of docker commands
* `docker info` to tell you about the current setup

##Docker Linking Containers

You can create a secure tunnel between containers so that they don't have to expose any ports externally. E.g. web container linked to a db container, we don't want to expose the db container

The syntax is to use the `--link` flag to link a source container (e.g. db) to provide information to a recipient container (e.g. web)

`docker run -d -P --name web --link db:db training/webapp python app.py`
