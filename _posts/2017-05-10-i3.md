# Summary

i3 is a tiling window manager that is lightweight and targetted for GNU/Linux.

# Config

Check out the user guide for i3 and make changes to your `~/.config/i3/config` file.
You can also customize the status bar in your `~/.config/i3status/config` file.

I changed some of the settings to be more vim like in navigation.

## Extra Installs

* lxappearance : allows you to change themes 
* thunar : file manager 
* ranger : file manager in console
* xrandr : for multiple monitors
* arandr : gui for configuring multiple monitors
* xwininfo -all : allows you to find details about a specific window (e.g.
  instance id so you can kill that window)
