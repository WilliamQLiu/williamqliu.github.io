# Summary

i3 is a tiling window manager that is lightweight and targetted for GNU/Linux.

# Config

Check out the user guide for i3 and make changes to your `~/.config/i3/config` file.
You can also customize the status bar in your `~/.config/i3status/config` file.

I changed some of the settings to be more vim like in navigation.

## Extra Installs

* lxappearance : allows you to change themes
* thunar : file manager
* ranger : file manager in console
* xrandr : for multiple monitors
* arandr : gui for configuring multiple monitors
* xwininfo -all : allows you to find details about a specific window (e.g.
  instance id so you can kill that window)

## Useful Commands

    i3-msg reload  # reload i3, e.g. after configs are changed
    i3-msg restart  # restart i3

## Xmodmap

I wouldn't use xmodmap, instead use `setxkbmap`.
If you want to remap any keys using xmodmap, add them to a ~/.Xmodmap file
To see what key is where, you can use `Xev` and it'll show you what keys are
pressed

### What is mapped

To see what is mapped:

    # This will show you every keycode
    xmodmap -pke

    xmodmap -pm
    +will@xps ~ $ xmodmap -pm
    xmodmap:  up to 5 keys per modifier, (keycodes in parentheses):
     
    shift       Shift_L (0x32),  Shift_R (0x3e)
    lock
    control     Control_L (0x25),  Control_R (0x69)
    mod1        Alt_L (0x40),  Alt_R (0x6c),  Meta_L (0xcd)
    mod2        Num_Lock (0x4d)
    mod3
    mod4        Super_L (0x42),  Super_L (0x85),  Super_R (0x86),  Super_L (0xce),  Hyper_L (0xcf)
    mod5        ISO_Level3_Shift (0x5c),  Mode_switch (0xcb)

Example File to remove caps lock key and add to mod4 key

    clear Lock
    keycode 66 = Hyper_L
    add mod4 = Hyper_L

Example Command to run new keymap:

    xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

## xkbmap

A more modern system is to `setxkbmap`

    # print out the current settings
    setxkbmap -query
    
    # Caps Lock as Ctrl
    setxkbmap -option ctrl:nocaps
