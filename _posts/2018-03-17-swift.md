## Setup

Make sure to download Xcode and it matches the iOS version. E.g. Xcode 9.1 matches iOS 11.1.

## Design Links

## Code Architecture

iOS uses MVC similar to web frameworks. We have:

* Models
* View
* Controllers (aka ViewController)

## Create New Project

Product Name: Name of App
Organization Identifier: Reverse Domain Name (e.g. com.williamqliu)

### Interface

Anything in Storyboard you can modify using the visual 'Interface Builder' or open 
'As Source Code' where you'll see XML

Actions are linked with:

* IBOutlet (e.g. Image changes based on Action)
* IBAction (e.g. click on Button)

### IB Connections

If everything is good, there'll be a filled circle showing that the connection is Active
If the circle is not filled, you'll get an uncaught exception that a class is not key value coding compliant
This might happen when you delete or change the name of an IBOutlet
Make sure to break your connection by right clicking on the object and removing the IBOutlet,
then recreate the connection (Ctrl and bring over your ImageView (should see a filled circle now)

## UIKit

The UIKit gives you prepackaged functionality like calling `arc4random_uniform()` for random numbers.

## Playgrounds

XCode has a playground, think a REPL for exploring around Swift and its libraries.

## Side Loading

Apple limits the number of apps you can side loan in a specific timeframe (think 3 per week).
Can work around this by removing the app from XCode.

# Swift Language

Statically typed; e.g. `var myAge: Int = 33`
camelCase

## Data Types

	var myAge : Int = 32
	myAge = 33
	let myName: String = "Will"
	let myDetails = "\(myName)"
	let agreeWithMe : Bool = true
	let floatingNumber : Float = 1.3
	let double : Double = 3.14.15

## Views

Views have properties; e.g. myImageView.image = UIImage(named: <assetName>) from Assets folder
