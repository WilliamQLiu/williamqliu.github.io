## Setup

Make sure to download Xcode and it matches the iOS version. E.g. Xcode 9.1 matches iOS 11.1.

## Design Links

Apple Human Interface Guidelines:
https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/themes/

Apple Documentation on App Icon Dimensions and Requirements

    https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1686/_index.html

## Code Architecture

iOS uses MVC similar to web frameworks. We have:

* Models
* View
* Controllers (aka ViewController)

## Create New Project

Product Name: Name of App
Organization Identifier: Reverse Domain Name (e.g. com.williamqliu)

### Interface

Anything in a __Storyboard__ you can modify using the visual 'Interface Builder' or open
'As Source Code' where you'll see XML

Actions are linked with:

* IBOutlet (e.g. Image changes based on Action)
* IBAction (e.g. click on Button)

### IB Connections

If everything is good, there'll be a filled circle showing that the connection is Active
If the circle is not filled, you'll get an uncaught exception that a class is not key value coding compliant
This might happen when you delete or change the name of an IBOutlet
Make sure to break your connection by right clicking on the object and removing the IBOutlet,
then recreate the connection (Ctrl and bring over your ImageView (should see a filled circle now)

## UIKit

The UIKit gives you prepackaged functionality like calling `arc4random_uniform()` for random numbers.

## Playgrounds

XCode has a playground, think a REPL for exploring around Swift and its libraries.

## Side Loading

Apple limits the number of apps you can side load in a specific timeframe (think 3 per week).
Can work around this by removing the app from XCode.

# Swift Language

Statically typed; e.g. `var myAge: Int = 33`
camelCase

## Strings

	var myAge : Int = 32
	myAge = 33
    let SSN = 4343434343  // let creates constants
	var myName: String = "Will"  // makes the variable a String type
    print(myName)
	var myDetails = "\(myName)"  // for string interpolation, use `\(myothervariable)`
    var stringWithPotential = String()
    var condition = "Hey" + " there"
	var agreeWithMe : Bool = true
	var floatingNumber : Float = 1.3
	var lbsPerMonth: Double = 10.232313

### String Methods and Properties

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/string

Methods: There are a lot of built in methods for Strings

    var eString = "Meet me in St. Louis"
    for character in eString.characters {
        if character == "e" {
            print("Found an e!")
        } else {
        }
    }

Properties: There are a lot of properties you can use as well

    var theTruth = "Money can't buy me love"
    theTruth.characters.count
    theTruth.characters.reversed()

## Debugging

    print("Hey")

    var lightSwitchOn: Bool = true
    print(type(of: lightSwitchOn))

## Arrays

    var nounArray = ["puppy", "laptop", "ocean"]
    var index1 = Int(random() % 9)

    // Insert words into a sensible sentence
    var sentence = "The \(nounArray[6]) spilled her \(nounArray[7])."

    // Randomly choose words to create a silly sentence
    var  sillySentence = "The \(nounArray[index1]) jumped over the \(nounArray[index2])."

## Functions

Three types of functions:

* Global Functions
* Nested Functions
* Methods




## Views

Views have properties; e.g. myImageView.image = UIImage(named: <assetName>) from Assets folder
