## Setup

Make sure to download Xcode and it matches the iOS version. E.g. Xcode 9.1 matches iOS 11.1.

## Design Links

## Code Architecture

iOS uses MVC similar to web frameworks. We have:

* Models
* View
* Controllers (aka ViewController)

## Create New Project

Product Name: Name of App
Organization Identifier: Reverse Domain Name (e.g. com.williamqliu)

### Interface

Anything in Storyboard you can modify in Interface Builder or open 'As Source Code'
where you'll see XML

Actions are linked with IBOutlet (e.g. Image changes based on Action) and IBAction (e.g. click on Button)
