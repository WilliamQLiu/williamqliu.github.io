## Building a Product

What is the problem you're solving?

* You have to know what problem you're solving
* You should be able to describe what you're solving in one sentence
* Have you yourself experienced the problem that you're solving
* Can you define this problem narrowly? Know the use case
* Is the problem solvable?

Who is your customer?

* Not everyone should be your customer (figure out ideal first customer)
* How often do they have the problem? E.g. frequency of buying a car (infrequent) vs selling a car (frequent)
* How intense is the problem?
* Are users willing to pay? If you want to know if its a good problem to solve, make it a little 
  harder to use (e.g have a price or a slightly higher price)
* How easy is it to find your customers?
