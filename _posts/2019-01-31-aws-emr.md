title: AWS Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) and S3
---


# {{ page.title }}

__Amazon EMR__ is a managed Hadoop framework that makes it easy and fast to do mass data processing.
EMR is great for handling tasks like log analysis, web indexing, data transformations (ETL).

## S3

Check if you need:

* Multipart Uploads - if not, then make sure settings is disabled
* Enable versioning on your S3 bucket so that if data is deleted accidentally, it can be recovered
* If you're sending a lot of GET requests, consider Amazon CloudFront to increase speed and decrease cost

### S3 Filtering

Remember that S3 doesn't know about subfolders/subdirectories. A slash is just a slash.
There's only one level of folders called __buckets__. Inside buckets are files, called __objects__ (aka __keys__)

Instead, S3 uses a __Prefix__ to filter the list. Only keys with a matching prefix are displayed.

S3 also allows a __delimiter__ with the `--delimiter=X` or `-d` (to use `/` as the delimiter)
