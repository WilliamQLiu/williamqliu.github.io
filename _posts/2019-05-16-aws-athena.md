**AWS Athena** is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze
data in S3 using standard SQL. You don't need to setup a server. Simply point to an S3,
define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL. Athena is more for
very simple reporting. Athena also supports CSV, JSON, Gzip files, and columnar formats
like Apache Parquet
