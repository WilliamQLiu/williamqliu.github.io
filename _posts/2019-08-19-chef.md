## Summary

__Chef__ is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang.
It uses a __domain-specific language__ (__DSL__) for writing system configuration __recipes__.
Chef helps solve the problem of configuring and maintaining (configure/manage) a company's servers.
Chef utilizes a __declarative__ approach, meaning we specify what the final configuration should be
and not have to specify exactly all the steps needed to make it happen.

## Infrastructure As Code

Chef falls under the whole __Infrastructure as Code__ idea. Benefits include:

* Lowers cost - we can reduce the human time required to provision and manage infrastructure
* Improves speed of provisioning - the machine can run the steps faster than a human can type
* Improves __stability__ and __security__ - allowing us to know exactly what is installed and how it is configured

## Chef Pieces

Chef is divided into the following pieces:

* __Chef DK (Development Kit)__
    * __Food Critic__
    * __Kitchen__
    * __ChefSpec__
    * __InSpec__
    * __Recipes__
    * __Cookbooks__
* __Chef Server__
    * __API__
    * __Data Storage__
    * __Search__
    * __High Availability__
    * __Cookbooks__
    * __Supermarket__
    * __Runlist__
    * __Policy__
* __Chef Client__
    * __Clients__ - Each client runs its own chef client to pull down recipes

## Desired State

Chef cares about the end result, not the steps to get there.

* Chef does a 'Test and Repair' approach that allows Chef to only make changes necessary to get a server back
to the desired state configuration.
* If a server already has the desired configuration/state, no changes happen

So what does this all mean? There's two ways to define our configuration, either __Imperative__ vs __Declarative__.

### Imperative Configuration

An imperative configuration might look like:

    yum install -y nginx
    systemctl start nginx
    systemctl enable nginx

We have to be very specific about what happens.

### Declarative Configuration (using Chef DSL)

A declarative configuration might look like:

    package "nginx"

    service "nginx" do
      action [:enable, :start]
    end

The above doesn't care if we're running systemd.
