# {{ page.title }}

Datadog is a a service that helps you monitor your infrastructure and applications.

## Dashboards

Dashboards lets you create queries, tables, and graphs to show you important metrics (e.g. network latency,
disk usage, out of memory, etc). Most of the time I'll add conditionals (if memory free is < X, then make red
instead of green)

## Integrations

You can add an integration (e.g. AWS MSK) and you'll get metrics you need (e.g. say cpu, memory, disk space) usage.


## Monitors

__Monitors__ allow you to detect changes in a metric, then alerts your team.
