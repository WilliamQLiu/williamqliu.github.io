# {{ page.title }}

Datadog is a a service that helps you monitor your infrastructure and applications.

## Dashboards

Dashboards lets you create queries, tables, and graphs to show you important metrics (e.g. network latency,
disk usage, out of memory, etc). Most of the time I'll add conditionals (if memory free is < X, then make red
instead of green)

## Integrations

You can add an integration (e.g. AWS MSK) and you'll get metrics you need (e.g. say cpu, memory, disk space) usage.

## Monitors

__Monitors__ allow you to detect changes in a metric, then alerts your team.

## Agents

You can install independent agents to run on your host to collect events and metrics, then send this back to Datadog.
Agents are installed on your OS (e.g. Ubuntu) and run with say `sudo service datadog-agent start`

### How it works

There is a __collector__ that gathers all standard metrics every 15 seconds
Then a __forwarder__ sends the metrics over HTTPS to Datadog

### datadog-agent cli

You can setup and run datadog-agent with `datadog-agent` as a CLI. Usage is:

    https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/basic_agent_usage/?tab=agentv6

### Embedded Agent

Datadog has an embedded python environment. You can find that here:

`/opt/datadog-agent/embedded/` has your embedded Python environment with common libraries like `python` and `pip`.

Install Python packages using the embedded pip with:

`sudo -Hu dd-agent /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/bin/pip install <package_name>`

### Built in Configuration and Integrations

`/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml` has the configuration files and folders for the Agent
`/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/` has datadog's built-in integrations
`/etc/datadog-agent/checks.d/` has your custom Agent checks (e.g. https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/write_agent_check/?tab=agentv6)
