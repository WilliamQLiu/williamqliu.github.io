# {{ page.title }}

__Alembic__ uses __SQLAlchemy__ as the underlying engine to do change management scripts for a relational database.
This is similar to Django or Rail's migration.

## Migration Environment

When Alembic starts, it creates the __Migration Environment__:

    myproject  # your application source code
      alembic/  # this directory is the home of the migration environment
        env.py  # this is a python script that is run whenever the alembic migration tool is called (usually connection/configuration)
        README
        script.py.mako  # the Mako template file used to generate new migration scripts; this creates what shows up in 'versions'
        alembic.ini  # the 'generic' configuration file (e.g. for a single generic database configuration)
        versions/  # the directory that holds the individual version scripts; ids in file names use a partial GUID approach
          3512b954651e_add_account.py
          2b1ae634e5cd_add_order_id.py
          3adcc9a56557_rename_username_field.py

## Running Migrations or Generating SQL Scripts

In your `env.py` file, you should determine when to use __online mode__ (run against db) or __offline mode__ (create sql)

### Offline Mode

In Alembic, you can generate migrations as SQL scripts instead of running them against the database; this is
called __offline mode__ and called with the `--sql` option. You might use this when access to DDL is restricted
and SQL scripts need to be passed to someone with higher privileges.

    alembic upgrade ae1027a6acf --sql

### Online Mode

In Alembic, you can run your migrations against a database; this is called __online mode__.

## alembic.ini

The file that the `alembic` script looks for when called. This `alembic.ini` is a configuration file that
points you to where the database migration(s) are, what loggers you have, etc.
