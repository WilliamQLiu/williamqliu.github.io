## Terminology

* Network Device - e.g. a computer, a printer, a mobile device, a server
* Network Interface Card (NIC) - wired or wireless, each network device has this card (usually built in to the device)
  If wired device (instead of wireless), it will have a wire that connects to a physical **switch** of an **access point**.
  A typical connector on a NIC is an RJ45 connector (RJ = registered jack) used for Ethernet networks
* Access Point (AP) - a network device that is used to forward data to it's destination
* Router - a network device that creates and maintains a local area network (as well as moves data inside of that network)

E.g. Will is on a computer (network device) that is connected to a switch (wireless or wired), which forwards
the request to the router, it forwards to a firewall, then to another router, then to the internet (a service provider).
