## Terminology

* Network Device - e.g. a computer, a printer, a mobile device, a server
* Network Interface Card (NIC) - wired or wireless, each network device has this card (usually built in to the device)
  If wired device (instead of wireless), it will have a wire that connects to a physical **switch** of an **access point**.
  A typical connector on a NIC is an RJ45 connector (RJ = registered jack) used for Ethernet networks
* Access Point (AP) - a network device that is used to forward data to it's destination
* Router - a network device that creates and maintains a local area network (as well as moves data inside of that network)

E.g. Will is on a computer (network device) that is connected to a switch (wireless or wired), which forwards
the request to the router, it forwards to a firewall, then to another router, then to the internet (a service provider).

## Protocol Stack (aka Network Stack)

A protocol stack (aka network stack) is an implementation of a computer networking protocol suite.

* Application Layer - Web Service, File Service
* Transport Layer (Layer 4) - TCP (slower, but reliable) vs UDP (faster, best attempt only, not reliable)
* Network Layer (Layer 3) - IP (Internet Protocol) Address (identify a specific device and on what network)
* Data-link Layer (Layer 2) - MAC (Media Access Control) Address (aka physical address). Each device has its own unique 12 character identifier (e.g. `9C-35-5B-5F-4C-D7`).
  Mac addresses are physically attached to a hardware device.
* Physical Layer (Layer 1)- Sending bits (0's or 1's) of data

So how does this all come together? A user's computer might request data from a web server, the web service associates
tcp as the transport protocol (how to send data), we would add the IP address of the server, add the mac address and send those bits.

The above is called a **TCP/IP** protocol stack.

Example Application Layer Services:

### DNS (Domain Name Service)

An important app service is **DNS** (domain name service), which converts a domain name (like google.com) into an IP address.
DNS uses the Layer 4 Transport Protocol of UDP and has a destination port of port 53, a source port (e.g. say port number is > 1024 like 38777, randomly picked and assigned if it's not in use)
Think of the source port and destination port as an envelope with sender and destination address.

### HTTP web service

An example of a web app using HTTP uses the Layer 4 of TCP and a destination port 80 and say a source port of 1553.
