title: Technical Coding Interview Cheat Sheet
---

# {{ page.title }}

## Summary

I got into software development through a fairly non-traditional path (Peace Corps, Nonprofits, then Software Engineering). When I first started interviewing, I naively thought it would be behavioral questions (since that's the only questions that I've seen). Needless to say, I failed my first few interviews.

I'm writing this post as what I would tell my younger self on how to study for a technical code / skills assessment.

1. Coding for interviews is a much different skillset than what you do at work.
   You need to specifically practice for this skillset (sorry, just the reality at most companies; will save my thoughts on this for another post)
2. Pick one language (the simpler and less verbose the better; I use Python)
3. Read the first few chapters of Cracking the Coding Interview (Note: solutions are in Java)
   Optionally pick up a language specific book (e.g. Elements of Programming Interviews in Python) and get the gist of what questions/solutions look like 
4. Learn those data structures and algorithms with [Neetcode.io](neetcode.io), a more targetted set of questions pulled from places like [Leetcode](leetcode.com) or other variations like [HackerRank](hackerrank.com). 
5. Interview

### Question Types

The types of questions you'll see are:

* Arrays & Hashes
* Two Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Stack
* Binary Search
* Linked List
* Trees
* Tries
* Heap / Priority Queue
* Backtracking
* Graphs
* Advanced Graphs
* 1-D Dynamic Programming
* 2-D Dynamic Programming
* Greedy
* Intervals
* Math & Geometry
* Bit Manipulation
