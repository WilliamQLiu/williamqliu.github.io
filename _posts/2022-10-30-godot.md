## Inheritance vs Composition

### Inheritance

In a world of Inheritance, we might have:

Player Object
* Attack
* Health
* Hitbox
* User Input

Enemy Object
* Attack
* Health
* Hitbox
* AI

With Inheritance, we can create a parent Entity that has:
* Attack
* Health
* Hitbox

This works until we run into something like a 'Tree'
* Tree is a StaticBody2D
* Player and Enemy are CharacterBody
* We can have two types of Entities (e.g. CharEntity and StaticEntity),
  but this starts getting complicated the more types of Entities you get

### Composition

We can have:

* AttackComponent
* HealthComponent
* HitboxComponent

Player
* AttackComponent
* HealthComponent
* HitboxComponent
* User Input

Enemy
* AttackComponent
* HealthComponent
* HitboxComponent
* AI

Tree
* HealthComponent
* HitboxComponent

## Game Loop (Over simplified)

Keep in mind your game will run at say 60 Frames Per Second so
don't run big for loops, complex calculations in your script lifecycles.

While(userNotQuitOrCrash):
    updatePhysics()
    Scene.updateScenePicture()  # Update images you're shown
    passToNodeScripts(userInput)
    performanceUpdate()  # Most game engines will handle this for you
    userNotQuitOrCrash = updateAppState()

Look at the `MainLoop.cpp` and `Main.cpp` file for details on this game loop.

## Nodes and Resources

Top main classes are 'Nodes' and 'Resources'

### Nodes

Node classes are functionality and behavior.

* Nodes represent behavior
* Nodes give you functionality (draw a sprite, simulate physics, manager player speed)
* Nodes have Class Inheritance

Example Nodes

* Spatial (a 3D game object)
* CanvasItem -> Node2D (a 2D game object)

### Resources

In the FileSystem (bottom left default), you can create a new 'Resource' class.
A resource is saved to the disk (file system).

* Resources are Data Containers
* All they do is hold data. Nodes rely on the data contained in resources

Example Resources

* Scenes
* GDScripts

## Script Lifecycle

Our game objects go through a life cycle of:

* Create/Start
* Exist
* Destroy/End

Lifecycle details:

1. "Enter Tree" - A scence is loaded from disk or created by a script
2. "Ready" - The root node of the newly instantiated scene is added as a child of the root viewport
  or to any child of it
3. "Player Input" - Every node of the newly added scene will receive the `enter_tree()` notification in top
  to bottom order
4. "Physics Processing" - The `ready()` notification is called when a node and all its children are inside the active scence
5. "Process" - While the object is active in the scence, callbacks such as the
   `_input()`, `_process()`, `_physics_process()` are called if used
6. "Exit Tree" - When a scene is removed, they receive the `exit scene` notification in bottom to top order
   So all the children will exist scene before the root node can exit

## Virtual Methods

__Virtual Methods__ allow subclasses of the base class type that has the virtual method to
override the method. If there is `virtual`, Godot will handle virtual method calls if they are
overridden. For example, a Node class has the following methods:

Node Methods

* void `_enter_tree()` virtual
* void `_exit_tree()` virtual
* String `_get_configuration_warning()` virtual
* void `_input(InputEvent event)` virtual
* void `_physics_process(float delta)` virtual
* void `_process(float delta)` virtual
* void `_ready()` virtual
* void `_unhandled_input(InputEvent event)` virtual

We can override these following virtual methods

### `_enter_tree()`

The `_enter_tree()` method is __always called__ when a scene (gameobject) enters the SceneTree.
The notification is Top-to-Bottom order.

How `_enter_tree()` plays:

```
root
  Parent
    Child1
      GrandChild1
    Child2
```
the order will be:

* Parent has entered the SceneTree
* Child1 has entered the SceneTree
* GrandChild1 has entered the SceneTree
* Child2 has entered the SceneTree

Before our scene is loaded, it'll be an inactive Node to an active Node.

E.g.
```
      SceneTree
          |
      Root Viewport
          |
Inactive: Node -> Active: Node (`_enter_tree()` is when a Node becomes Active)
```

When do you need to use `_enter_tree()`?

* If you don't know if you should be using it, then you most likely don't need it
* If you need property values reset and/or some type of action to happen immediately
  (every time the Node is active on the SceneTree)
* Good for Scenes (Gameobjects) that will be active and inactive, and never released from memory
* `_enter_tree()` is very specialized; prioritize `_ready()` over `_enter_tree()` when setting initial property values

### `_ready()` method

* The `_ready()` function can be used by any class that inherits from the Node class
* The Root Nodes's `_ready()` function is called last (i.e. __calls lowest children first__)
* The `_ready()` method is __called only once__
* If you remove a node and add it back to the scene, it will NOT call the `_ready()` method again

Example

```
Root
  Child1
    GrandChild1
      GreatGrandChild1
    AnotherGrandChild1
  Child2
    GrandChild2

will call:

GreatGrandChild1 _ready() method is called
GrandChild1 _ready() method is called
AnotherGrandChild1 _ready() method is called
Child1 _ready() method is called
GrandChild2 _ready() method is called
Child2 _ready() method is called
Root _ready() method is called
```

Does the Root have children? If so, go to Child. If not, did the `_ready()` method get called?

Note: Just because a node has been deleted/set to inactive (no longer there in the SceneTree),
it doesn't mean it's been removed from memory.

When to use?

* Use the ready function when you only want to initialize default property values once when
  an object is created/added to the scene
* Default Player health, points, items, etc.

### Delta Time w/ `_process()`

__Delta Time (elapsed time)__ is a concepted used by programmers in relation to hardware and network responsiveness.
In Godot, delta time is a __float__ value. For game programming, we refer to the elapsed time between the last frame
that was drawn and the current frame that is drawn.

Issues between different computer speeds:

F1 -> delta time -> F2 -> delta time -> F3 -> delta time -> F4

Say we have a game running 4FPS and one with 60FPS.

We have a __framerate dependent__ calculation
* 4FPS = 100 pixels/s = 25 pixels/frame
* 60FPS = 60 pixels * 25 pixels / frame = 1500 pixels / second

We can have a __framerate independent__ by using __delta time__

* For any __movement__, use delta time
* Any physics dealing with time, we want to use delta time

Godot gives you two virtual methods to handle delta time:

```
_process(delta):
    pass

_physics_process(delta):
    pass
```

#### `_process(delta)` method

* Gives us the ability to be __frame independent__ (i.e. not synced to the hardware, runs same on all hardware fast and slow)
* If overridden by Node, it will run at every frame possible

When to use:

* When you need an action called, or something updated as the __fastest possible rate (real time)__
* Smoothest movement possible that the physics process virtual method is unable to output (i.e. do not use for movement)

When not to use:

* The delta value is not reliable, it prefers speed over consistency
* The default settings for New Projects sometimes has `_process(delta)` run slower than `_physics_process(delta)`

Never remove `vsync` (default on); if you do, then our `_process(delta)` method is called as quickly as possible
and we will not be frame independent anymore.

#### `_process_physics(delta)` method

* Gives us the ability to be __frame independent__
* If overridden by Node, delta will be capped at 1/60 (Default), 60 frames per second, 0.1 seconds per 6 frames (delta is constant)
* Frame rate is synced to the physics
* Frame rate is a constant

When to use:

* Dealing with physics, such as movement
* Custom Timers (Not using the Timer Node)
* Ideal for Game Logic (Path Finding, updating positions)

When not to use:

* Delta is capped at 1/60 (cannot go faster)
* You may not get the smoothest "visual" animations (varies)

#### physics vs physics_process opinions

* Start out with `_physics_process(delta)`
* If it feels weird, then upgrade to `_process(delta)`
* If the game is slow and bottleneck is `_process(delta)`, switch back to `_physics_process(delta)`

### Player Input

Player Input includes:

* Mouse Movements
* Mouse Clicks
* Keyboard Inputs
* Controller Inputs

The easiest way for Godot to handle keyboard input is through the Application's "Input Map Tab"

4 common input virtual methods from Node Class:

* `func _input(event):`
* `func _gui_input(event):`
* `func _unhandled_input(event):`
* `func_unhandled_key_input(event):`

How does this fit in?

```
User Input -> OS -> Scene Tree -> Root ViewPort ->
  1. Input
  2. Control Node (GUI Input)
  3. Unhandled Input
```

Input works __Bottom to Top__ order with by first looking to see if the `_input(event)` method was called on any of the
nodes, then bottom to top again on `_gui_input(event)`, then `_unhandled_input(event)`, etc.

Just keep in mind you have to exit the InputEvent otherwise the input event will be passed along.

#### Control Class

Control < CanvasItem < Node < Object

#### `func _unhandled_input(InputEvent event):`

* unhandled input is the third input event handler to be called
* You want your player input controls here; that way player controls don't interfere with Control Node input handlers

#### So what does this mean?

You don't want player input at higher levels (e.g. `_input`, `_gui_input`) because you want priority to go to
say "Pausing the Game". You don't want a player to shoot their gun while the game is paused.

#### `func_unhandled_key_input(event):`

This will only get called if a key press was/is detected (mouse movement does not activate this function).
Consider using this for input dealing with key presses.

#### `CollisionObject._input_event()`

* Fourth input handler to be called
* Collision Object is a Node Class, inherited by Area and Physics Body

#### Viewport

* Last to be called
* If input chain has been unhandled, the input event will be passed to the next viewport on the tree
* When events are propagated, we must stop it through the Root Viewport Singletonn, meaning we have to manually call:
  `self.get_tree().get_root().set_input_as_handled()`

#### InputEvent Class

* InputEvent class is the base class for all sorts of Input Data
* Godot 'under the hood' will convert the user input data and pass down a class that holds the relevant data, usually
  a subclass of the InputEvent class
* If you look up the [InputEvent](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputevent.html) class, you see that it inherits 'Resources' < 'Reference' < 'Object'
* InputEvent class is inherited by a few classes including: `InputEventWithModifiers` (keyboard, mice, trackpad)

Example code:

```
func _input(event):
    if event is InputEventKey:
        if event.scancode == KEY_RIGHT:
            print("Right key pressed")
    else:
        print(event)
```

### `_exit_tree()`

All code logic inside the `_exit_tree()` virtual method gets called when the node is removed from the scene tree.

Code:

```
func _exit_tree():
    # recommended below - doesn't do anything until you add or remove nodes
    # self.queue_free()
    pass

# Notice it takes no arguments and returns back no value (void)
```

The easiest thing to do as a beginner is to delete the node from memory after it has left the scene tree.
Recommended to use `queue_free()` inside the `_exit_tree()` method for all Nodes because memory management is complex.
Best not to have memory leaks and just delete everything that leaves the scene tree.

#### Two ways of deleting from memory

* `Node.queue_free()` - queues a node for deletion at the end of the current frame.
  When deleted, all children nodes are deleted. This method makes sure it is safe to delete the node and is safer
  than using `Object.free()`. This is the __preferred method__.
* `Object.free()` - deletes the object from memory. Any pre-existing reference to the freed object will become invalid
  with no built in safety measures.

### Adding and Removing Nodes from Scene Tree

Remember that removing an Object/Node from the Scene Tree does not remove the Node from Memory.
You need to use `Node.queue_free()` or `Object.free()`.
When a node is removed from the scene it is an __Orphaned Node__, but not deleted from Memory.

```
add_child(<node_object>):
    pass

remove_child(<node_object>):
    pass
```

#### Memory Management

You can use a technique called __Object Pooling__ for handling memory performance, which is more performant than `Node.queue_free()`.
The theory is you have an Active node (e.g. a sprite node) that is on a Scene, then we create a new variable in another node
and point this new variable to the old node. We then remove our Active node from Scene and can restore from the variable.
This is a more advanced technique (again, beginners should just use `Node.queue_free()` for now).

## Pivot Point / Offsets

A __Pivot Point__ (aka __Offset__) is the reference point (a pair value in an x,y coordinate system) for positioning,
rotating, and scaling a game object. A pivot point is where the transformation portion of our Node object gets affected at.
We want our pivot point in the center of our images, which makes boundary calculations easy to do.

We can create a complete image using __Skeletal Animation/Rigging__ instead of a __Spritesheet__.

## Window Basics

__Resolution__ is pixels in each direction (width x height) with an __Aspect Ratio__ of 16:9 (x 120), the ratio of width to its height

For game programming, there are two different window values we can retrieve:

1. Player Device Screen/Resolution (e.g. laptop, monitor, cellphone)
2. Game Window / Resolution Size (our game), where we draw our images

Godot offers a global `OS` singleton class

```
1. Player Device Screen/Resolution
# getter method only
screen = OS.get_screen_size()

# returns a Vector2(float x, float y)

2. Game View Resolution
# setter
vector2 = Vector2(float x, float y)
OS.set_window_size(vector2)

# Getter returns Vectors2
game = OS.get_window_size()
```

### Window Position

Game Window offset is top left

```
vector2 = Vector2(float x, float y)
OS.set_window_position(vector2)
position = OS.get_window_position()
```

### Window Resizing (Default: true)

```
# getter method
OS.is_window_resizable()  # returns boolean

# setter method (if you don't want user to resize
OS.set_window_resizable(false)
```

Full Screen or Borderless Window

```
OS.set_window_fullscreen(true)

OS.set_borderless_window(true)  # unable to move
```

### OS Orientation

If you develop for mobile, pick landscape (Godot default) OR portrait.

```
SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE = 0
SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT = 1
```

### Built-in Scaling

Godot offers us a way through project settings to handle built-in scaling for us under

Project Setting > Display > Window > Stretch (One Size Fits All Solution)

Recommended Starting Settings:

* Mode: 2d
* Aspect: expand
* Shrink: 1

For mobile game dev, would recommend a mix of one size fits all method in addition to scaling for individual images

Before applying scaling, pick a Static Game Window Size Width during Development (e.g. 1920 x 1080).
Images need to have a width and height that can fit your game without scaling

Calculations:

New Resolution / Original Resolution = Conversion
New Ratio = Conversion * Original Ratio

e.g.
Resolution: 1920 x 1080 = Image Ratio 1:1
Resolution: 100 x 100 = Image Ratio 0.052: 0.052 for X aspect change (100/1920 = 0.052), 0.092: 0.092 for Y aspect change (100/1080 = 0.092)

## Images

### Summary

* CanvasItem Class (lets you hide or show an image)
  * Sprite Class (lets you draw an image on the screen)
    * Texture Class (the width and height of the image)
      * Image Class (the actual image)

### CanvasItem Class

`CanvasItem Class(Visibility)`

* `set_visible(bool)` - show image onto the game screen
* `is_visible() -> bool` - check if image is visible or not
* `hide()` - shortcut method to hide image
* `show()` - shortcut method to show image

### Sprite Class

* Used with the Sprite Node
* Displays a 2D texture (Sprite Sheets)
* Cannot edit image directly

Properties:

* offset - how it affects your sprite depends on the centered property
  * `set_offset(Vector2)`
  * `get_offset()` -> Vector2
* centered - how it affects your sprite depends on the centered property
  * `set_centered(bool)`
  * `is_offset()` -> bool
* texture - object to draw, example is the image (most important Sprite property)
  * `set_texture(Texture)`
  * `get_texture()` -> Texture

### Texture Class

* Textures are items you can create by loading from a file
* Texture is a base for other resources; it __cannot be used directly__
* E.g. your image/png is a `StreamTexture` < Texture (inherits from Texture)

Methods:

* `get_size()` -> Vector2
* `get_height()` -> int
* `get_width()` -> int
* `get_data()` -> Image (very important)

### Image Class

* Native Image datatype and contains your image data, which is then/can be convertered to a Texture
* Can edit our image file

Methods:

* `get_size()` -> Vector2
* `get_height()` -> int
* `get_width()` -> int

You do not want to edit and save images directly through the Godot editor (use an image editing software)

* `resize(int width, int height, Interpolation = 1)`
* `shrink_x2()` -> void
* `expand_x2_hq2x()` -> void
* `save_png("save file path")`

## Coding Notes

* Aim to use functions over raw code in your virtual functions; i.e. make your virtual functions call your custom functions
* Function names with similar task should stay consistent (e.g. verb or noun), e.g. start `setup`

E.g.

```
extends Sprite

func _enter_tree():
    myCustomCode()

func _physics_process(_delta):
    myCustomCode()

func myCustomCode() -> void:
    pass
```

## Collision

* A __collision__ is a short duration interaction between two bodies (or more) causing change in motion of bodies
* Collisions are based on Shapes. These shapes can be as simple as squares/rectangles and circles, or more complex shapes (Polygons)
* Collisions are detected by algorithms (can be simple or complex)
* Collision detection is expensive
* Performant Collisions has a 1.) Broad Phase that checks if objects are close to each other, then a 2.) Narrow Phase
  that checks collisions with objects next to each other. Godot handles this for us.

### Collision Shapes

* Collisions define the area of an object inside the physics engine
* `CollisionShape2D` is the class Godot uses in order to define a space in which the collision algorithm can work with in
  detecting when Game Objects intersect/collide.
* Collision Shapes by themselves are useless; they need to be attached to a Node that inherits from the `CollisionObject2D` class.
* Can mix or match

### CollisionShape2D

The first property `Shape` tells us what kind of Shape this collision object is, e.g. `RectangleShape2D`.
The simpler the shape, the more performant your game will be (Simpler Shapes > Polygons)
If multiple CollisionShape2D objects are "ON", Godot uses the UNION of all of those objects

* __One Way Collision__ - if you want a character to jump through an object, but not fall through
* __One Way Collision__ - The thickness of the object
* Can change the size, but do NOT change the scale

Allows you to pick:

* `ConvexPolygonShape2D` - Godot assumes you are using a convex polygon; simple polygon in which no line segment between two points
  goes outside the polygon. Interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Godot decomposes the shape into as many convex
  polygons as possible to make sure all collision checks are against a convex polygon. These are faster to check.
* `ConcavePolygonShape2D` - Godot assumes you are using a concave polygon; a polygon where one or more interior angles is
  greater than 180 degrees. Do not use this for `RigidBody2D`.

### CollisionShape2DPolygon

Easier to work with, especially if your polygon changes dynamically over time
More expensive, but allows more detailed shapes (i.e. more Vertices/edges).
Basically the same as `CollisionShape2D` with two extra properties:

* `build_mode`
  * Enum value (0, 1)
    * Polygon (Solids or Segments)
* `polygon`
  * `PoolVector2Array` (vector specifically made to hold Vector2D, optimized for memory)
    * Polygon (`PoolVector2Array`)

## PhysicsBody2D

* `PhysicsBody2D` is the base class for all objects that are affected by physics in 2D space
* If you want collisions where objects don't intersect by default, think of `*Body2D` Nodes

Godot gives us the options of:

* `StaticBody2D`
* `RigidBody2D`
* `KinimaticBody2D`

### `StaticBody2D`

* The standard Node when dealing with non-moving objects (i.e. __static__).
* Floors, walls, ceilings, pillars, etc.
* Any object where you will never have the intention of utilizing physics based reactions (pushing)
* Does not mean it can't affect other bodies (e.g. can have friction)

### `RigidBody2D`

* Use `RigidBody2D` when you want to have physics forces applied to your game object (e.g. Gravity, friction)
* `RigidBody2D` is not meant to be used for user controlled game objects (e.g. your Main Player Character)

### `KinimaticBody2D`

* Meant for User controlled game objects
* Useful when you want your player to affect/be affected by other `*Body2D` Nodes
* When moving towards a static body, you would like your player to be unable to move
* When moving towards a rigid body, you would like it to move the rigid body game object

Methods:

* `move_and_collide(Vector2)` - when you would like your game object to stop moving after a collision has been
  internally detected.
* `move_and_slide(Vector2)` - it stops your game object from moving in the direction of a 'blocked' path (slides)
  If you move southwest (diagonal) and there happens to be a floor, your game object will just move West (at a reduced speed)

## Randomness

Two categories:

* Input Randomness
* Output Randomness

### Input Randomness

* aka __Pre-Luck__
* things that happen before player control in a game (e.g. who starts their first turn, what cards you get in Poker)

### Output Randomness

* aka __Post-Luck__
* things that happen after your player makes a decision (e.g. D&D, you tell the DM you want to attack a creature and you
  roll a dice to see if the attack lands)

### True Random Numbers vs Pseudorandom Number

True Random Numbers are hard; uses a measurement/algorithm system
Pseudorandom is given to us by a `RandomNumberGenerator` Class with a default seed
* With a default value, you will have predictable numbers; results will be the same throughout
* Randomize the seed value using `RandomNumberGenerator.randomize()`, which is a time-based seed

### Functions

* `int randi()` returns 0 - 4294967295
* `int randi_range(int from, int to)`

## Timers

Can have count up timers (e.g. speed run), count down timers (e.g. pass a level in X time), refresh timer for skills,
new monsters spawning. We can write with custom code or use a `Timer` node.

### raw code

Use raw code when you want to do something other than counting down.

Example basic raw code for a timer

```
var timeCounter: float = 0.0
var timeLeft: int = 10

func _physics_process(delta) -> void:
    timeCounter += delta
    if( int(timeCounter) == 1):
        timeLeft -= 1
        timeCounter = 0
        print(timeLeft)
```

### `Timer` node

* Inherits from the `Node` class
* Means we get the basic life cycles
* For the Node to properly work, needs to added to the Scene Tree
* Use when you need the ability to countdown (the Timer node makes this very easy)

Properties:

* `autostart` # default is false
* `paused` # default is false
* `one_shot` # default is false, loops the timer
* `wait_time` # set to 1.0

Methods:

* `start(float time_sec = -1)`
* `stop()`
* `connect("timeout", self, "methodName")` by using __Timer Node Signals__

How to put it together:

1. Add a Time Node to the Scene Tree
2. Connect your function call to the `timeout()` signal method
3. Call the `start(float time)` method
   By default, will restart again

Code Example:

```
extends Timer

func _read() -> void:
    wait_time = 3.0
    connect("timeout", self, "printHello")
    start()

func printHello():
    print("Hello World")
```

## `CanvasItem` Class

* The `CanvasItem` Class is the Base class of anything 2D.
* CanvasItem is extended/inherited by Control (GUI) and Node2D class.
* CanvasItems are drawn in tree order
* A Root CanvasItem will be drawn behind everything else
* If you hide a parent, you hide its children

Methods

* `_draw()` virtual method - You have to define drawing methods inside the `draw()` virtual method or nothing will be drawn
* `update()` method - queues the canvas drawing for update. Use this when changing drawning positions/colors/etc
* `hide()` - makes your canvas item invisible
* `show()` - unhides your canvas item
* remember that code is still running even if items are not visible, lifecycles are not paused
* `modulate` - a `Color` class data type that can apply Color to your texture (applies to your children too)
* `self_modulate` - only applies Color to parent

How do I draw things on the Screen with CanvasItem?

* `draw_line(Vector2 from, Vector2 to, Color color, float width=1.0, bool antialiased=false)`
* `draw_multiline(PoolVector2Array points, Color color, float width=1.0, bool antialiased=false)`
   with a `var name = PoolVector2Array([Vector2(0,0), ...])`
* `draw_circle(Vector2 position, float radius, Color color)`
* `draw_rect(Rect2 rect, Color color, bool filled=true, float width=1.0, bool antialiased=false)`
  with a `var name = Rect2(float x, float y, float width, float height)`
* `draw_primitive(PoolVector2Array points, PoolColorArray colors, PoolVector2Array uvs, Texture texture=null,
  float width=1.0, Texture normal_map=null)  # for dots (1 point), lines (2), triangles (3), quads (4), uv (Texture coordinates for each vertex)`
* `draw_string(Font font, Vector2 position, String text, Color modulate=Color(1,1,1,1), int clip_w=-1)` for text

## Camera2D Node

* Simple Node that allows control of the view camera in 2D Scenes
* Forces the screen to follow this node
* `Camera2D` < `Node2D` < `CanvasItem` < `Node` < `Object` Inheritance
  * `Node2D`: position property
  * `Node`: access to Script Lifecycles
* You can have multiple Camera2D Nodes inside the SceneTree
* You can only have one Camera2D Node active at once (`current` property - default is false)
* If no cameras are active, the Root Viewport is shown
* You can set `Current` property to true and the camera will follow the Player

Methods

* `make_current()` -> void, makes the current Camera2D Node the active camera in the SceneTree
* `align()` if you experience camera lag, to align the camera to the tracked node

## Control Node

* The __Control Node__ is the base class for all UI-related nodes
* All user interface type nodes inherit from the Control Node
* Control Nodes adapt its anchors and margins based on the position/size of its relative parent

Basics:

* `Anchor` - __Starting Position/Origin__: it must starts its position somewhere along the edges of your parent Control Node
  * Anchor defaults are Left: 0, Top: 0, Right: 0, Bottom: 0, will position to the Top Left of the screen
* `Margin` - how many pixels away from anchor in terms of the X axis and Y axis
  * Left and Top affects size, Right and Bottom affects location
* `Grow Direction` - which direction does it grow? Horizontal, Vertical
  * Can be `End` (Grow Away from the Origin)
  * Can be `Begin` (Grow towards the Origin)
  * Can be `Both` (Growth Away and towards the Origin)
* `Rect`
  * Position (in relation to game screen origin)
  * Rotation (in relation to its pivot/offset)
  * Size
  * Min Size - cannot go below this threshold

## Viewport

* The root viewport is the window to our game world; usually this default setup is generally all you need
* Sometimes you want multiple viewports if you want to have Split Screen or Mini-maps
* You can also mix and match 3D world with 2D scenes
* We may have multiple viewports subclassed to the root viewport
* A viewport creates a different view onto the screen
* Viewports can have multiple cameras, but only 1 camera can be active at a time per viewport

### General Setup of Viewports

* A Control Node
  * A Viewport Container
    * A Viewport

Methods:

* `get_viewport().size.x`  # width of viewport
* `get_viewport().size.y`  # height of viewport

## Changing Scenes

Example of changing Scenes: Splash Screen -> Main Menu -> Game -> Credits

You can change scenes 3 ways:

* Delete an existing scene through Godot's built-in swapping functionality (do not have to worry about orphan nodes)
* Hide a scene (`CanvasItem` has a `hide()`)
* Remove a scene while also keeping a reference to the scence through variables (__Object Pooling__)

### Changing Scene Functionality

These will delete the current scene immediately when called.

* `SceneTree.change_scene()`
* `SceneTree.change_scene_to()`

### SceneTree Global Class

* The Scene Tree manages the hierarchy of nodes in a scene
* To get the current scene tree, we use the global `get_tree()` method

#### `change_scene()`

Code:

```
get_tree().change_scene(String path)

var sceneTwo:String="res://Scene2.tscn"
get_tree().change_scene(sceneTwo)
```

#### `change_scene_to()`

Code:

```
get_tree().change_scene_to(PackedScene packed_scene)
var sceneTwo = preload("res://Scene2.tscn")
get_tree().change_scene_to(sceneTwo)
```

#### Error Enums

If changing a scene runs into an error, you'll run into these Error Enum values:

* OK: 0
* Fail/Issues > 0

## Buttons

__Buttons__ are needed to have a pressable item so we can create:

* Main Menu
* Pause Menu Screen
* Back Button on Credits Screen

### States of Clickable UI (General)

UI can have the following states:

* Default - Button not doing anything, the default state, say e.g. blue
* Active - When you click/press the button, e.g. darker color of the default state
* Disabled - Disabled state of the button, e.g. grayed out
* Hover - When you hover over the button, shows you can click on it, e.g. lighter blue color
* Focus - The user has already clicked the button, e.g. purple
* Loading - After clicking the button, set a loading animation (app is doing something)

### `Button` Node

`Button` < `BaseButton` < `Control` < `CanvasItem` < `Node` < `Object`

Comes with 5 states:

* Hover
* Pressed/Active
* Focus
* Disabled
* Normal

If we attach a script, we can get the following methods and properties:

* `_pressed()` virtual
* `_is_hovered()`
* `Disabled` (Boolean)
* `Pressed` (Boolean)

The `Toggle Mode` lets you toggle between staying pressed or popping back to a default state

#### Button Signals:

* `button_down()`
* `button_up()`
* `pressed()`

### `TextureButton` Node

Great for amazing looking buttons

`TextureButton` < `BaseButton` < `Control` < `CanvasItem` < `Node` < `Object`

5 states:

* Hover
* Pressed/Active
* Focus
* Disabled
* Normal

## Persistent Data

* Data that doesn't change over time and memory
* Most games save game state, examples being Player Stats, Levels Unlocked, etc.
* You can save to local storage or to cloud storage
* For local storage, you can save to a Singleton that can be accessed from any script under `AutoLoad`, `Enable`.


Code:

Say you have a Singleton with:

```

#PlayerStats.gd
var level = 1
var player_name = "Will"

#You can access this globally through other scripts with
PlayerStats.player_name
```

Steps:

1. Open File
2. Open Stream Type (there's different types, including Input Stream, Output Stream, Input/Output Stream)
3. Read/Write File # depends on the stream
4. Close File

How to save:

* Save or read line by line with each line going into a dictionary, e.g. `myFile.store_line(to_json(saveData))`
* Each dictionary should be converted to JSON
* When a game is exported to a device, the files become __read only__
* For local dev, you can read and write

Paths:

* __User Paths__ -> `user://file.txt`
* For dev:
  * MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/<Project Name>`
  * Windows: `%APPDATA%\Godot\`
  * Linux: `~/.local/share/godot/`
